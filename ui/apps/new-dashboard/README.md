## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be integrated into any TanStack Start application.

After following the [Clerk TanStack Start quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/tanstack-start?utm_source=DevRel&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=templates&utm_content=08-05-2023&utm_term=clerk-tanstack-start-quickstart), you will have learned how to:

- Create a new TanStack Start application
- Install `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`
- Set up your environment keys
- Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app
- Wrap your Root Component with `<ClerkProvider />`
- Use Clerk components to protect your content
- Embed the `<SignInButton />` and `<SignOutButton />`
- Deploy your application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clerk/clerk-tanstack-start-quickstart
