## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be integrated into any TanStack Start application.

- Create a new TanStack Start application
- Install `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`
- Set up your environment keys
- Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app
- Wrap your Root Component with `<ClerkProvider />`
- Use Clerk components to protect your content
