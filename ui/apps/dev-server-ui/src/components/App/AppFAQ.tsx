                  Your Inngest functions are defined and execute within your application. To enable
                  Inngest to fetch your function configuration and invoke functions, it must be able
                  to reach your app "Syncing" tells Inngest where your app is running.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Syncing an app works by providing Inngest with the URL of your application's{' '}
                  <code>serve()</code> handler endpoint, typically at{' '}
                  <code>&lt;your-hostname&gt;/api/inngest</code>. When you sync an app, Inngest
                  reads the configuration of your app and functions and stores the URL to send
                  future invocation requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As your functions may change, it is necessary to sync your app whenever it
                  changes. The Inngest Dev Server does this by polling for changes every 5 seconds
                  by default.
