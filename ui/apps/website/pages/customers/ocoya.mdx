Learn how Ocoya uses Inngest to develop and deliver their world
class product in record time, with end-to-end local testing.

## Ocoya: Workflows + Queues

Every aspect of Ocoya requires complex workflows, from scheduling
social media content to e-commerce imports. Traditionally,
developing this functionality requires setting up multiple queues,
dead-letter queues, services, subscribers, and backoffs, along with
code for delivering to each queue.

Only a subset of their engineering team could handle queues & infra,
and it wasn't locally testable. Plus, code was also split over many
codebases, making debugging or changes difficult.

### Fixing problems: out with the old, in with the new.

When planning and designing their e-commerce product range, Ocoya
wanted to **simplify and speed up development across their entire team**.
Using Inngest, Ocoya was able to write their business logic
directly as serverless functions without worrying about queues. This
allowed them to:

* Speed up development of all business logic
* Enable local development for everyone in the team
* Simplify code into a single codebase, deploying reliable functions
  to Vercel
* Remove all queueing infrastructure
* Rely on the same CI/CD process via Vercel

Additionally, using Inngest allows for easier debugging: any failed
functions are easily retryable, and the triggering event can be
copied and ran locally to instantly replay functions in development.

With just a few weeks of development, an entire new product category
was planned, developed, and launched to production reliably, using
Inngest, providing a better customer experience than ever before.

## Moving forward

After implementing e-commerce imports and functionality in record
time, both new and existing features can be refactored into this new
way of working, **unlocking better reliability, easier developing,
faster debugging, and better performance**.

With the integration of Inngest, Ocoya can focus on their core
product — delivering a world class product that enables users to
deliver AI-enhanced social media and e-commerce content better than
ever before.
