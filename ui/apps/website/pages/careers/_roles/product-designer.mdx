Product Design at Inngest is a fun and challenging role. Inngest is solving long standing developer problems in a novel way which means we're creating first-of-it's-kind user interfaces and experiences. You'll get to design experiences developers have only dreamed of.

Our overall developer experience spans from writing code with our SDK; to running our Dev Server for best-in-class local development; to using our cloud dashboard to monitor, observe and debug production systems. Your work will directly help design a cohesive user experience, wherever the user is along that journey.

- The [Dev Server UI](https://www.inngest.com/docs/local-development) is the companion to our SDK during local development. Developers use it for hours a day to get a fast feedback loop to rapidly iterate on their work. It needs to strike a balance of being informative and also streamlined.
- Our cloud dashboard is where developers operate their production systems. They need to quickly find and debug production issues and fix them. It's monitoring dashboards & observability tools can save developers hours of investigation.

You will be the second member of Inngest's design team. As an early member, you will play an influential role in shaping the user experience of Inngest. You will work with and report to Inngest's Design Leader to ensure consistent and engaging design.

Additionally, you will collaborate with the founders and our incredible team of engineers to craft a world-class experience every developer in the world can use.

While experience with dev tools or B2B products is useful, it's not required.  We only require that you can ask great questions and dig into customer needs.
