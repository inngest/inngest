              <h3>Information Security Program</h3>
              <p>
                We have an Information Security Program in place that is communicated throughout the
                organization. Our Information Security Program follows the criteria set forth by the
                SOC 2 Framework. SOC 2 is a widely known information security auditing procedure
                created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

              <h3>Third-Party Audits</h3>
              <p>
                Our organization undergoes independent third-party assessments to test our security
                and compliance controls.
              </p>

              <h3>Third-Party Penetration Testing</h3>
              <p>
                We perform an independent third-party penetration at least annually to ensure that
                the security posture of our services is uncompromised.
              </p>

              <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>

              </p>
              <p>
                Where available we have Single Sign-on (SSO), 2-factor authentication (2FA) and
                strong password policies to ensure access to cloud services are protected.

              <h3>Quarterly Access Reviews</h3>
              <p>
