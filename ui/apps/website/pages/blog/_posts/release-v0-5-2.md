[Inngest v0.5.2 is here](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/releases)! This patch introduces a few new pieces of functionality, as well as various fixes and improvements. The key pieces are:

- **Strict function rollbacks**, meaning any time you change a single step’s code you can roll back to previous versions.
- **Improved `inngest init`,** showing you every event you’ve seen when creating functions, plus the ability to bypass questions via flags.

Read more about our [future plans in our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/inngest/projects/1), and if you want to propose new features or ideas feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/discussions) or [chat with us in discord](/discord). Let’s dive in!

## Strict rollbacks

Inngest automatically versions every step function that you deploy. This allows you to see a full change log for each of your functions, plus the ability to immediately roll back to a previous version if desired.

We’ve updated our function configuration format to make rollbacks _stricter —_ to always ensure that you roll back every step to the correct state for each version.

## Inngest init

Using `inngest init` is the easiest way to create new serverless functions. You’ll often want to create a function which responds to an event that you’ve already processed within your account. In the latest version, `inngest init` automatically fetches every event you’ve seen in your account so that you can create new functions that run any time these events are seen again in the future.
