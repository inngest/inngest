Serverless functions are fantastic for reducing your operational burden. For a long time, though, theyâ€™ve been limited to more basic API handlers, or small scripts that donâ€™t live within your core infrastructure.  Anything more complex requires orchestration or heading into the complexity of AWSâ€™ step functions.

**With our latest release weâ€™re excited to launch language-agnostic, locally testable step functions**.  You can now compose complex sequences of logic as [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) â€” using any language, without any infrastructure, queues, state, or config.

Letâ€™s show you an example, then talk about their uses, benefits and how they work â€” plus our future plans for things like integrating webassembly and a local step-over debugger.

## A quick example

An example is worth far more than a description.  Hereâ€™s an example sign-up flow function definition, which: sends a welcome email;  adds the user to stripe (for non-free plans);  analyzes the signupâ€™s company info;  then depending on the analysis sends a message in slack.

Weâ€™re using a sign-up flow because itâ€™s familiar to *everyone* but you can do anything you need here â€” whether thatâ€™s data pipelines, user journeys, managing webhooks, complex queue pipelines, etc.

Hereâ€™s the step function flow and itâ€™s configuration:

![step-fns.png](/assets/blog/step-fns.png)

```json
 {
  "name": "Sign-up flow",
  "id": "improved-chamois-c592a7",
  "triggers": [
    { "event": "auth0/user.created" }
  ],
  "steps": {

    "welcome": {
      "id": "welcome",
      "name": "Send a welcome email",
      // The path links to the source code for the step.
      "path": "file://./steps/welcome",
      "runtime": {
        // This lets us run steps in eg. webassembly also.
        "type": "docker"
      },
      "after": [{
        "step": "$trigger"
      }]
    },

    "stripe": {
      "id": "stripe",
      "name": "Add the user to stripe",
      "path": "file://./steps/stripe",
      "runtime": {
        "type": "docker"
      },
      "after": [{
        "step": "welcome",
        "if": "event.data.plan != 'free'"
      }]
    },

    "enrich": {
      "id": "enrich",
      "name": "Enrich signup data",
      "path": "file://./steps/enrich",
      "runtime": {
        "type": "docker"
      },
      "after": [{
        "step": "welcome"
      }]
    },

    "notify": {
      "id": "notify",
      "name": "Notify sales team",
      "path": "file://./steps/slack",
      "runtime": {
        "type": "docker"
      },
      "after": [{
        "step": "enrich",
        "if": "steps.enrich.value >= 1000"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example weâ€™re defining a function thatâ€™s triggered by an Auth0 event (really, it can be an API call, an integration, a webhook, a schedule, Kafka, etc.).  Then weâ€™re defining each step, and the order of operations.

Step functions here try to avoid complexity:  in this example they simply say the step they run after, and an optional expression which will be evaluated to conditionally run based off of the event data *and* the output of previous steps.

If youâ€™re interested you can [dive straight into our docs for more info](/docs/functions/multi-step).

## Locally test step functions

Best of all, itâ€™s possible to locally test these functions using our CLI with a single command: `inngest run`.  This builds each step, then executes the function locally using the same execution engine that runs in production.  No more hours-long feedback loops as you deploy things in your cloud!

## The benefits:  best practices

Step functions have a lot of benefits over simple serverless functions or queues as they enforce **best practices** which are common within traditional engineering.

For one, by splitting logic up into steps, youâ€™re **reducing complexity** of each part â€” which makes things easier to write, test, debug, and deploy.

Theyâ€™re also more **reliable**.  Each step is retried independently on failure, so other parts of the pipeline arenâ€™t impacted if there are intermittent external errors other parts of the pipeline arenâ€™t impacted.

Each step is **reusable**.  You can call shared code from many functions, just like you would from a library.  Weâ€™re also planning to release an extensive library of open-source steps so that you can plug and play common features like sending messages via email, SMS, Slack, etc, data analysis, and API integrations (if thereâ€™s stuff you want to see, [drop us a note in discord](/discord) or a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/issues)).

And finally, by moving your logic outside of your critical path youâ€™re making sure your API responds as fast as possible, reducing any latency by offloading unnecessary applications.

## Powerful features

Weâ€™ve also added some powerful features to our step functions under the hood.

The main killer feature is **event coordination:  the ability to pause your step function until specific events are received (or not), then automatically resume.**  The easiest example here is cart abandonment:

![step-fns-timeout.png](/assets/blog/step-fns-timeout.png)

<aside>
<p>ðŸ’¡ Event coordination unlocks powerful functionality such as:</p>

<p>Run a function when a user adds a product to their cart (`cart/product.added`), then wait for the checkout event *from the same user* for up to 24 hours.  If this isnâ€™t received, send the user a discount.</p>

</aside>

You can declaratively specify the events that must occur between each step of a function with zero orchestration, coordination, or infrastructure.  This lets you build billion dollar functionality in minutes that you get with Braze or Segment â€” without other tools.

## Future plans

This is the initial release of step functions, and we have lots of future plans:

- A step-over debugger built into our local CLI, allowing you to inspect and manipulate function state as you develop
- `Promise.all`-like functionality, allowing you to run steps only after many previous steps have finished
- A library of open-source reusable steps, allowing you to build out functionality without writing a line of code

You can try out step functions for free by grabbing our CLI and [signing up for an account](https://app.inngest.com/sign-up?ref=step-fns-post).

Weâ€™d also love to hear your [feedback, thoughts, and requests via Github issues](https://www.github.com/inngest/inngest) or by [hopping into our discord to chat with us](/discord).  Finally, the source code for this is [freely available in our CLI](https://www.github.com/inngest/inngest).%
