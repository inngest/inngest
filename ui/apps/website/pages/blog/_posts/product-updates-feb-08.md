Hello fellow Inngesters! Here are our recent changes and what's brewing for the beginning of Feb. Time flies!

## Recently released

We've released a few things to help improve your dev lifecycle:

- **Better event typing, with Typescript generation**. Weâ€™ve improved how we handle typing your events - weâ€™re now generating Cue types, JSON schemas, and Typescript types for every version of your event. Over time, weâ€™ll be extending this to support SDK generation (so that you can get a library for safely creating your events), other language support,
- **Better performance.** Parts of our system have been tweaked to reduce latency by 60x.
- **A new event experience.** This week we're launching a new event page which highlights workflows, versions, and the above types in a smoother UI
- **A smoother serverless function experience.** Very soon weâ€™re making it easy to create single JS-based serverless functions that run any time events are received.
- **Bug fixes & reliability fixes.** Weâ€™ve tweaked our architecture, fixed numerous bugs (thanks for reporting), and improved our systems to make working with us a little nicer ðŸ™‚

## What's coming

Our core value is making developerâ€™s lives easier. We're hard at work revamping the entire experience to simplify event driven serverless:

- **A new website.** This week weâ€™re redesigning our website to talk about our core offering: the event mesh. The event mesh manages and aggregates every event in your system, and provides tooling over the entire event lifecycle to make development simple and fast.
- **A new CLI experience.** As part of our ethos to making development easy, weâ€™re redesigning our CLI experience to make working with event-driven programming as simple as possible.
- **Open-source execution engine.** Weâ€™re still working on open-sourcing the executor engine, which weâ€™ll bundle into the CLI so that you can test workflows locally, without deploying. You can be sure your serverless functions work before putting them into prod.

## Talk with us!

Weâ€™re always open to feedback.
