Hello fellow Inngesters! We’re kicking off 2022 with a new process. We’re starting bi-weekly product updates, giving you insight into the development happening over at Inngest.

## Recently released

We’re happy to announce the following features:

- **Workflow throttling.** Even with thousands of events, specify a throttle and ensure that your workflow runs a limited number of times. Here’s the specifics, from the product owner himself:

You can specify a throttle configuration for workflows through the `throttle_count` and `throttle_period` fields. Both fields needs a value for throttling to take effect. For example, to trigger a workflow at most once per day you can specify:

```
throttle_count: 1
throttle_period: 1d
```

Magic! Even if you’re _flooded_ with events we’ll only run your workflow once.

- **Automatic error workflows**. Now, you can create special `error_alert` workflows. You can have these workflows automatically run any time any of your regular workflows fail. Have a flaky API? We’ll retry it automatically, but if it keeps failing and the workflow errors you can now specify the logic that should run when things issue out.
- **Auth with GitHub**. Yes, we’re developers. We (likely) have GitHub accounts. Why not auth using GitHub? Well, now you can.
- **Trigger expressions**. You can now specify expressions within your trigger. Want to only run a workflow if your order is over $500 from shopify? Instead of handling this within the workflow, you can now specify it on the trigger itself. We won’t even create a workflow if the data doesn’t match up.
- **UI fixes, improvements, and updates.** We’re always working on this for you, and you’ll notice some improvements to our new dark mode.

## What’s coming

We’re also hard at work on many new features — a lot of which will improve your experience using Inngest directly. Here’s a sneak peek:

- **Single-functon workflows.** We’re making it effortless to react to events by letting you define single serverless functions that run as a workflow. You can tie this into CI/CD and have a full end-to-end event-driven serverless system. Lots to come here, including Next.JS integrations, GitHub actions integrations, etc.
- **A new event experience.** We’re hard at work redefining how we manage your events. It includes automatic cue type generation, json-schema generation, and SDKs from event types, plus a new browser and the ability to handle change management of events from our UI.
- **Open-source execution engine.** We’re working on open-sourcing the engine that powers running our workflows into its own public repository. We’ll be opening up the cue types and the executor itself — so you can run your own workflows using our CLI or your own tooling!
- **A new onboarding experience.** We’re crafting a new experience to help you get started with event-driven serverless functions.
