We're thrilled to announce the release of Inngest's TypeScript SDK v2.0, featuring some powerful new features alongside some housekeeping to keep the SDK a consistent, smooth experience.

Check out the [v2 migration guide](/docs/sdk/migration?ref=blog-sdk-2-0) to learn how to upgrade today.

## Better Event Typing

Previously, types were defined using a verbose structure and could be passed as generics in several ways. Issues with this resulted in large, difficult to parse TypeScript errors which weren't helpful to the end developer.

We've built some new foundation for this in v2, including support for [Zod](https://zod.dev/?ref=inngest).

```ts
export const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "Admin Panel",
  schemas: new EventSchemas()
    .fromRecord<Events>()
    .fromUnion<Custom1 | Custom2>()
    .fromZod(zodEventSchemas),
});
```

This provides everyone with massive benefits:

- Improves discoverability of each way to specify event payload types
- You get specific, easy-to-fix errors for each method
- Gives Inngest the ability to easily add support for new methods (including generated types in the future)
- Gives Inngest space to add schema definition options in the future like `.allowUntyped()`

Internally, this change also frees up the Inngest client from being passed a type, allowing us to perform even better type inference and build more powerful tooling, like middleware.

Check out [Defining Event Payload Types](/docs/reference/client/create?ref=blog-sdk-2-0#defining-event-payload-types) to learn about specifying types in v2.

## Middleware

Following the schema change, we can now add middleware. Middleware allows you to hook into various lifecycles of an Inngest client to add custom functionality.

Some everyday use cases for middleware include:

- Error monitoring (check out our [Sentry example](/docs/reference/middleware/examples?ref=blog-sdk-2-0#sentry-error-reporting-and-tracing))
- Data transformations
- Logging support (check out our [logging example](/docs/reference/middleware/examples?ref=blog-sdk-2-0#logging))
- Pre-run setup like connecting to databases
- Adding tooling or patterns using Inngest's step tooling as building blocks

It even hooks into the Inngest client's typing, meaning you can use middleware to enhance your client however you see fit.

```ts
import { Inngest, InngestMiddleware } from "inngest";

const myMiddleware = new InngestMiddleware({
  name: "My Middleware",
  init() {
    return {
      onFunctionRun({ fn }) {
        // This will be logged whenever a function is executed
        console.log(`Function ${fn.name} is running!`);

        // This is where you can optionally specify hooks for this particular run
        return {
          afterExecution() {
            console.log(`Function ${fn.name} has finished running!`);
          },
        };
      },
    };
  },
});

const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My App",
  middleware: [myMiddleware],
});
```

One of our aims with middleware is to make sure it's powerful enough to use for some of our own internal code in the SDK itself; we can't wait to see what you do with it!

Check out the [Advanced: Middleware](/docs/reference/middleware/overview/?ref=blog-sdk-2-0) documentation to get started with middleware and see some examples.

## Logging

Powered by middleware, Inngest functions now provide a `logger` that can be used to reliably push logs either to the `console` (by default) or using a logger of your choice ([Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston), [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), or [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan), for example).

```ts
const fn = inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "My awesome function" },
  { event: "func/awesome" },
  async ({ event, step, logger }) => {
    logger.info("starting function", { metadataKey: "metadataValue" })

    await step.run("do something", () => {
      if (somethingBadHappens) logger.warn("something bad happened")
    })

    return { success: true, event }
  }
)
```

Logging in serverless environments is often tricky, and a common problem we see is that users lose logs when the runtime is cleaned up by the platform. In addition, Inngest's ability to pause and resume a function's execution days, weeks, or months later means that a regular logger could run multiple times, resulting in duplicated logs.

This `logger` accounts for all that, meaning you can immediately ship logs with your favorite logger.

Check out [Logging in Inngest](/docs/guides/logging/?ref=blog-sdk-2-0) to see how to get started specifying your own logger and see how we add helpful metadata to your logs, too!

## What's next

Version 2.0 of the Inngest TypeScript SDK has established a strong foundation for supporting a broad range of external tools and services, allowing seamless integration with your favorite existing tools, services, and platforms.

With these new foundations in place, we can focus on further refining and expanding upon these concepts, ultimately providing you with even more powerful tools and features in the future.

We're excited to see what you'll create with v2! Check out the [v2 migration guide](/docs/sdk/migration?ref=blog-sdk-2-0) to learn how to upgrade today.
