  `Get started with Inngest in this ten-minute tutorial`

# Quick start

In this tutorial you will add Inngest to a Next.js app to see how easy it can be to build complex workflows.

Inngest makes it easy to build, manage, and execute reliable workflows. Some use cases include scheduling drip marketing campaigns and payment flows, or chaining LLM interactions.

By the end of this ten-minute tutorial you will:
- Set up and run Inngest on your machine.
- Write your first Inngest function.
- Trigger your function from code and Inngest Dev Server.

Let's get started!

### Choose Next.js version

Choose your preferred Next.js version for this tutorial:

<GuideSelector
  options={[
    { key: "nextappdir", title: "Next.js - App Router" },
    { key: "nextpages", title: "Next.js - Pages Router" }
  ]}>

## Before you start: choose a project

In this tutorial you can use any existing Next.js project, or you can create a new one.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Instructions to create a new Next.js project </strong></summary>

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js project:

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --ts --eslint --tailwind --no-src-dir --no-app --import-alias='@/*' inngest-guide
```
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --ts --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias='@/*' inngest-guide
```
</GuideSection>

</details>

Open the chosen project in your code editor. 

Next, start your Next.js app in development mode by running:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now you can add Inngest to your project!

## 1. Install Inngest

With the Next.js app now running running open a new tab in your terminal. In your project directory's root, run the following command to install Inngest SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "yarn" }}
yarn add inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "pnpm" }}
pnpm add inngest
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Run Inngest Dev Server

Next, start the [Inngest Dev Server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/local-development#inngest-dev-server), which is a fast, in-memory version of Inngest where you can quickly send and view events events and function runs:

```
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>You should see a similar output:</strong></summary>

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
$ npx inngest-cli@latest dev

        Inngest Dev Server online at 0.0.0.0:8288, visible at the following URLs:

          - http://127.0.0.1:8288 (http://localhost:8288)
```

</CodeGroup>

</details>

In your browser open [`http://localhost:8288`](http://localhost:8288) to see the development UI where later you will test the functions you write:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with no events recorded"
/>

## 3. Create an Inngest client

Inngest invokes your functions securely via an API endpoint at `/api/inngest`. To enable that, you will create an [Inngest client](/docs/reference/client/create) in your Next.js project, which you will use to send events and create functions.

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
  Create a new file at `./pages/api/inngest.ts` with the following code:

  ```ts {{ filename: "pages/api/inngest.ts" }}
  import { Inngest } from "inngest";
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";

  // Create a client to send and receive events
  export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

  // Create an API that serves zero functions
  export default serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      /* your functions will be passed here later! */
    ],
  });
  ```
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
  Make a new directory next to your `app` directory (for example, `src/inngest`) where you'll define your Inngest functions and the client.
  
  In this directory create an Inngest client:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/inngest/client.ts" }}
  import { Inngest } from "inngest";

  // Create a client to send and receive events
  export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });
  ```

Next, you will set up a route handler for the `/api/inngest` route. To do so, create a file inside your `app` directory (for example, at `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`) with the following code:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/inngest/route.ts" }}
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";

  // Create an API that serves zero functions
  export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      /* your functions will be passed here later! */
    ],
  });
  ```

</GuideSection>

## 4. Write your first Inngest function

In this step, you will write your first reliable serverless function. This function will be triggered whenever a specific event occurs (in our case, it will be `test/hello.world`). Then, it will sleep for a second and return a "Hello, World!".

### Define the function

<details>
  <summary><strong>To define the function, use the [`createFunction`](/docs/reference/functions/create) method.</strong></summary>

  The `createFunction` method takes three objects as arguments:
    - **Configuration**: `id` is required and it is the default name that will be displayed on the Inngest dashboard to refer to your function. You can also specify [additional options](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#configuration) such as `concurrency`, `rateLimit`, `retries`, or `batchEvents`, and others.
    - **Trigger**: `event` is the name of the event that triggers your function. Alternatively, you can use `cron` to specify a schedule to trigger this function.
    - **Handler**: the function that is called when the event is received. You can also specify [additional options](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/create#handler) such as invoking other functions from inside this function or logging data.
</details>

<GuideSection show="nextpages">

Add the following code to the `./pages/api/inngest.ts` file:

  ```ts
  // Step 2 code...
  const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "hello-world" },
    { event: "test/hello.world" },
    async ({ event, step }) => {
      await step.sleep("wait-a-moment", "1s");
      return { event, body: "Hello, World!" };
    },
  );
  ```
  
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">

  Inside your `src/inngest` directory create a new file called `functions.ts` where you will define Inngest functions. Add the following code:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/inngest/functions.ts" }}
  import { inngest } from "./client";

  export const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "hello-world" },
    { event: "test/hello.world" },
    async ({ event, step }) => {
      await step.sleep("wait-a-moment", "1s");
      return { event, body: "Hello, World!" };
    },
  );
  ```

</GuideSection>

### Add the function to `serve()`

<GuideSection show="nextpages">

  Next, add your Inngest function to the `serve()` handler.

  ```ts
  export default serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      helloWorld, // <-- This is where you'll always add your new functions
    ],
  });
  ```

</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">

  Next, import your Inngest function in the routes handler (`src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`) and add it to the `serve` handler so Inngest can invoke it via HTTP:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/inngest/route.ts" }}
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";
  import { helloWorld } from "../../../inngest/functions";

  export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      helloWorld, // <-- This is where you'll always add all your functions
    ],
  });
  ```

</GuideSection>

<Callout>
üëâ Note that you can import [`serve()`](/docs/reference/serve) for other frameworks and the rest of the code, in fact, remains the same ‚Äî only the import statement changes (instead of `inngest/next`, it would be `inngest/astro`, `inngest/remix`, and so on).
</Callout>

Now, it's time to run your function!

## 5. Trigger your function from the development UI

<details>
  <summary><strong>Inngest is powered by events.</strong></summary>

It is worth mentioning here that an event-driven approach allows you to:
- Trigger one _or_ multiple functions from one event.
- Store received events for a historical record of what happened in your application.
- Use stored events to replay functions when there are issues in production.
- Interact with long-running functions by sending new events (cancel, wait for input, and other).
</details>

You will test your first event in two ways: by sending it directly to the Inngest UI, and then by triggering it from code.

With your Next.js and Inngest Dev Servers running, head over to Inngest Dev Server ([`http://localhost:8288`](http://localhost:8288)):

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with no events recorded"
/>

To send a test event, click on ‚ÄúTest Event‚Äù in the top right corner: 

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-frame.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with no events recorded and the test button highlighted"
/>

In the popup console, add the event name (which you defined in the `createFunction` method earlier) and some test metadata like an email address and press the "Send Event" button:

```json
{
  "name": "test/hello.world",
  "data": {
    "email": "test-user@example.com"
  }
}
```

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-test-event-console.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Event console with test data"
/>

The event is sent to Inngest (which is running locally) and automatically executes your function in the background! You can see the new function run logged in the stream tab:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-event-1.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with one event recorded"
/>

When you click on the run, you will see more information about the event such as which function was triggered, its payload, output, and timeline:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/event-details-1.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Event details popup"
/>

In our case, the event triggered the `hello-world` function, which did sleep for a second and then returned `"Hello, World!"`. No surprises here, that's what we expected!

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/event-details-1-frames.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Event details popup indicating that hello-world function ran, that it slept for 1s, and that the correct body was returned"
/>

A handy little trick: if your event behaved in an odd way, you can either replay it or edit and replay it. Replaying a function can be really helpful in debugging the function errors locally. To try it, click on the "Replay" button in the top center:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/event-details-1-replay.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Event details popup with replay button highlighted"
/>

After the event was replayed, there are two events recorded in the dashboard:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-event-2.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with two events recorded"
/>

Now you will trigger an event from inside your app.

## 6. Trigger from code

To run functions reliably in your app, you'll need to send an event to Inngest. Once the event is received, it is forwarded to all functions that listen to it.

<details>
  <summary><strong>To send an event from your code, you can use the `Inngest` client's `send()` method.</strong></summary>

Note that with the `send` method used below you now can:
- Send one or more events within any API route.
- Include any data you need in your function within the `data` object.

In a real-world app, you might send events from API routes that perform an action, like registering users (for example, `app/user.signup`) or creating something (for example, `app/report.created`).

</details>

You will now send an event from the ‚Äúhello‚Äù Next.js API function. To do so, create a new API handler at the <GuideSection show="nextpages">`./pages/api/hello.ts`</GuideSection><GuideSection show="nextappdir">`src/app/api/hello/route.ts`</GuideSection> file:

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/hello/route.ts" }}
  import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
  import { inngest } from "./inngest";

  // Opt out of caching; every request should send a new event
  export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

  // Create a simple async Next.js API route handler
  export default async function handler(
    req: NextApiRequest,
    res: NextApiResponse,
  ) {
    // Send your event payload to Inngest
    await inngest.send({
      name: "test/hello.world",
      data: {
        email: "testFromNext@example.com",
      },
    });

    res.status(200).json({ name: "Hello Inngest from Next!" });
  }
  ```
</GuideSection>
<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/hello/route.ts" }}
  import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client"; // Import our client

  // Opt out of caching; every request should send a new event
  export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

  // Create a simple async Next.js API route handler
  export async function GET() {
    // Send your event payload to Inngest
    await inngest.send({
      name: "test/hello.world",
      data: {
        email: "testFromNext@example.com",
      },
    });

    return NextResponse.json({ name: "Hello Inngest from Next!" });
  }
  ```
</GuideSection>

<Callout>
üëâ Note that we use [`"force-dynamic"`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) to ensure we always send a new event on every request. In most situations, you'll probably want to send an event during a `POST` request so that you don't need this config option.
</Callout>

Every time this API route is requested, an event is sent to Inngest. To test it, open [`http://localhost:3000/api/hello`](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) (change your port if your Next.js app is running elsewhere). You should see the following output: `{"name":"Hello Inngest from Next!"}`

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/hello-from-next.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Black screen with the JSON statement"
/>

If you go back to the Inngest Dev Server, you will see this new event appear there as well:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-event-3.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with three events recorded"
/>

However, what happens if you send a different event? Let's see! Change `test/hello.world` to `test/hello.bizarro.world` and refresh [`http://localhost:3000/api/hello`](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). You will see that the event was sent and received:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-event-4.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Inngest Dev Server screen with four events recorded, last one being 'test/hello.bizarro.world' with no functions called"
/>

... but no functions were triggered because there is not a single function in your app that is listening to such a bizarre event:

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-event-4-details.png"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
  alt="Event details for the last event where it's clear that while the event was recorded, no function was called"
/>

And - that's it! You now have learned how to create Inngest functions and you have sent events to trigger those functions. Congratulations ü•≥
