# Environment Variables

You can set environment variables to change various parts of Inngest's configuration.

We'll look at all available environment variables here, what to set them to, and what our recommendations are for their use.

---

## INNGEST_BASE_URL

Use this to tell an SDK the host to use to communicate with Inngest.

If set, it should be the host including the protocol and port, e.g. `http://localhost:8288` or `https://my.tunnel.com`. Can be overwritten by manually specifying `baseUrl` in `new Inngest()` or `serve()`.

In most cases we recommend keeping this unset. A common case, though, is wanting to force a production build of your app to use the Inngest Dev Server instead of Inngest Cloud for local integration testing or similar.

In this case, set `INNGEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8288`, or wherever your Inngest Dev Server is accessible. For docker, this might be `http://host.docker.internal:8288`.

## INNGEST_ENV

Use this to tell Inngest which [envionment](/docs/platform/environments?ref=environment-variables) you're wanting to send and receive events from.

Can be overwritten by manually specifying `env` in `new Inngest()`.

This is detected and set automatically for some platforms, but others will need manual action. See [Configuring branch environments](/docs/platform/environments#configuring-branch-environments?ref=environment-variables) to see if you need this.

---

## INNGEST_EVENT_KEY

The key to use to send events to Inngest. See [Creating an Event Key](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key?ref=environment-variables) for more information.

Can be overwritten by manually specifying `eventKey` in `new Inngest()`.

---

## INNGEST_LOG_LEVEL

The log level to use for the SDK. Can be one of `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, or `silent`.

Defaults to `info`.

---

## INNGEST_SERVE_HOST

The host used to access this application from Inngest Cloud.

If set, it should be the host including the protocol and port, e.g. `http://localhost:8288` or `https://my.tunnel.com`. Can be overwritten by manually specifying `serveHost` in `serve()`.

By default, an SDK will try to infer this using request details such as the `Host` header, but sometimes this isn't possible (e.g. when running in a more controlled environment such as AWS Lambda or when dealing with proxies/redirects).

---

## INNGEST_SERVE_PATH

The path used to access this application from Inngest Cloud.

If set, it should be a valid URL path with a leading `/`, e.g. `/api/inngest`.

By default, an SDK will try to infer this using request details, but sometimes this isn't possible (e.g. when running in a more controlled environment such as AWS Lambda or when dealing with proxies/redirects).

---

## INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY

The key used to sign requests to and from Inngest to ensure secure communication. See [Serve - Signing Key](/docs/sdk/serve#signing-key?ref=environment-variables) for more information.

Can be overwritten by manually specifying `signingKey` in `serve()`.

---

## INNGEST_STREAMING

Sets an SDK's streaming support, potentially circumventing restrictive request timeouts and other limitations. See [Streaming](/docs/streaming?ref=environment-variables) for more information.

Can be one of `allow`, `force`, or `false`.

By default, this is `false`, disabling streaming. It can also be overwritten by setting `streaming` in `serve()` with the same values.
