# Installing the SDK

The Inngest SDK allows you to write reliable, durable functions in your existing projects incrementally. Functions can be automatically triggered by events or run on a schedule without infrastructure, and can be fully serverless or added to your existing HTTP server.

- It works with any framework and platform by using HTTP to call your functions
- It supports serverless providers, without any additional infrastructure
- It fully supports TypeScript out of the box
- You can locally test your code without any extra setup

## Getting started

To get started, install the SDK via your favorite package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "pnpm" }}
pnpm add inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "yarn" }}
yarn add inngest
```
</CodeGroup>

You'll need to do a few things to get set up, which will only take a few minutes.

1. [Set up and serve the Inngest API for your framework](/docs/sdk/serve)
2. [Define and write your functions](/docs/functions)
3. [Trigger functions with events](/docs/events)
