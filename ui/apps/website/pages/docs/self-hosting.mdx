# Self-hosting

Self-hosting Inngest is not currently supported.

It's our goal to provide a best-in-class developer experience which means a focus on
rapid development of our cloud platform.

Our [free tier](/pricing) enables teams to test the platform at no cost and options like
[encryption middleware](/docs/reference/middleware/examples#e2-e-encryption) enable most teams
to work around the most stringent of data requirements.

If your needs still demand self-hosting, please share more context on the "Self hosting" project
that we're tracking on our [roadmap][roadmap].
