# TypeScript with Middleware <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

Some lifecycle hooks can be used to mutate both values and types at key points in a particular lifecycle. The SDK leverages TypeScript's inference powers to make writing middleware easy for both the developer and the user.

## Mutating input

We can alter the input arguments for a function run (event data, `step` tooling, etc.), using `onFunctionRun`'s `transformInput()` hook. (See [Middleware - Lifecycle - Hook reference](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#hook-reference) for a list of all available hooks.)

```ts {{ title: "inngest/middleware/inputAlteration.ts" }}
new InngestMiddleware({
  name: "Input Alteration",
  init() {
    return {
      onFunctionRun() {
        return {
          transformInput() {
            return {
              ctx: {
                /**
                 * This is a new property that will appear in my function.
                 */
                foo: "bar",
              },
            };
          },
        };
      },
    };
  },
});
```

```ts {{ title: "inngest/fns/myFunction.ts" }}
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "example-function" },
  { event: "app/user.created" },
  async ({ event, foo }) => {
    //             ^? (parameter) foo: string
  }
);
```

As you can see above, all of our functions now have access to the `foo` variable within our function's input, including typing from the SDK inferring the alterations.

We can use this pattern to add additional typed tooling to function runs.

When returning a new `ctx` object, only specify the properties you wish to mutate. Omitting a property will use the default provided by the library, keeping complex types intact.

### Advanced mutation

When middleware runs and `transformInput()` returns a new `ctx`, the types and data within that returned `ctx` are merged on top of the default provided by the library. This means that you can use a few tricks to overwrite data and types safely and more accurately.

For example, here we use a `const` assertion to infer the literal value of our `foo` example above.

```ts
// In middleware
transformInput() {
  return {
    ctx: {
      foo: "bar",
    } as const,
  };
}

// In a function
async ({ event, foo }) => {
  //             ^? (parameter) foo: "bar"
}
```

Because the returned `ctx` object and the default are merged together, sometimes good inferred types are overwritten by more generic types from middleware. A common example of this might be when handling event data in middleware.

To get around this, you can provide the data but omit the type by using an `as` type assertion. For example, here we use a type assertion to add `foo` and alter the event data without affecting the type.

```ts
async transformInput({ ctx }) {
  const event = await decrypt(ctx.event);

  const newCtx = {
    foo: "bar",
    event,
  };

  return {
    // Don't affect the `event` type
    ctx: newCtx as Omit<typeof newCtx, "event">,
  };
},
```

## Ordering middleware and types

Middleware runs in the order specified when registering it (see [Middleware - Lifecycle - Registering and order](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#registering-and-order)), which affects typing too.

When inferring a mutated input or output, the SDK will apply changes from each middleware in sequence, just as it will at runtime. This means that for two middlewares that add a `foo` value to input arguments, the last one to run will be what it seen both in types and at runtime.
