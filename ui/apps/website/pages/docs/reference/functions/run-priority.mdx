# Function run priority <VersionBadge version="v3.2.1+" />

Defining a function's run priority allows you to **prioritize specific function runs above other runs within the same function**.  For example:

- Given you have a single function
- And you initialize two function runs at the same time, A and B
- Function run priority allows you to run run B ahead of A

This is useful to prioritize specific function runs, such as ensuring paid user's functions run ahead of free users when scheduled at similar times.

```ts
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "synchronize-data",
    priority: {
      // Allow runs to have a dynamic "factor" between -600 and 600.  This changes
      // the order of jobs in the queue;  returning `120` means that this new run should
      // execute before any jobs enqueued in the last 120 seconds (as it has a higher priority).
      //
      // Example:
      //
      // If two jobs are enqueued at time 150 (t150) with the following factors:
      //
      //  - Job X: t150, factor 0 (no expression or data)
      //  - Job Y: t150, factor 120
      //
      // Then Job Y will run ahead of Job X.  Job Y will also run before any jobs scheduled
      // 120 seconds beforehand.  Visually:
      //
      //   Jobs:          [A,  B,  C, ]
      //   Priority/Time: [10, 40, 130]
      //
      // Becomes:
      //
      //   Jobs:          [A,  Y,  B,  C,   X]
      //   Priority/Time: [10, 30, 40, 130, 150]
      //
      // Job Y's score becomes 30 (t150 - 120 = 30), going before any other work except job A.
      //
      // NOTE: returning a negative number delays the function run's jobs by the given value
      // in seconds.
      run: "event.data.account_type == 'enterprise' ? 120 : 0",
    },
  },
  { event: "intercom/company.updated" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
  }
);
```

## How `priority.run` works

**The queue**

Within Inngest, each function's scheduled runs is a priority queue scored by the time that jobs
should run.  When you create new function runs by sending events, a new job is inserted into the
queue with a score of the current time (as a millisecond epoch).

**Expressions**

Any time a new function run is scheduled, Inngest evaluates the `priority.run` expression given
the input event's data.  By default, this returns 0.

For example, the expression `"event.data.plan == 'enterprise' ? 300 : 0"` may return 300 or 0.  If
an event's `data.plan` field equals `enterprise`, the expression returns `300`.

Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info.

**Prioritization**

We take the returning number from the expression, and subtract this from the function run's epoch
time (as seconds).  Returning `300` subtracts 300 seconds from the function run's epoch time,
pushing the new run ahead of any other functions in the last 300 seconds (5 minutes).

If two function runs are scheduled at similar times, the functions with a higher priority run sooner
when at capacity.

**Fairness**

The expression defined within `priority.run` has a max return value of 600 by default, though this
can be increased upon request.

That is, we only skew a function run's priority by up to 600 seconds.  This ensures that you can
never starve work older than 600 seconds;  the longer a run exists in the queue without work,
the more likely it is to be worked on.

Using this model, it's impossible to stave work on lower priority items and functions always exhibit
some level of fairness.

## Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="priority" type="object">
    Options to configure how to prioritize functions

    <Properties nested={true}>
      <Property name="run" type="string">
        An expression which must return an integer between -600 and 600 (by default), with higher return
        values resulting in a higher priority.

        Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info. Examples:

        * Return the priority within an event directly: `event.data.priority` (where
	  `event.data.priority` is an int within your account's range)
        * Rate limit by a string field: `event.data.plan == 'enterprise' ? 180 : 0`


      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Callout>
  Return values outside of your account's range (by default, -600 to 600) will automatically be clipped
  to your max bounds.

  An invalid expression will evaluate to 0, as in "no priority".
