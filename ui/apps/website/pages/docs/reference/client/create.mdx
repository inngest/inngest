# Create the Inngest Client

The `Inngest` client object is used to configure your application, enabling you to create functions and send events.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-application",
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My application",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string" required>
    A unique identifier for your application. We recommend a hyphenated slug.
  </Property>
  <Property name="eventKey" type="string">
    An Inngest [Event Key](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key). Alternatively, set the [`INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`](/docs/sdk/environment-variables#inngest-event-key) environment variable.
  </Property>
  <Property name="schemas" type="EventSchemas" version="v2.0.0+">
    Event payload types. See [Defining Event Payload Types](#defining-event-payload-types).
  </Property>
  <Property name="logger" type="Logger" version="v2.0.0+">
    A logger object that provides the following interfaces (`.info()`, `.warn()`, `.error()`, `.debug()`). Defaults to using `console` if not provided. Overwrites [`INNGEST_LOG_LEVEL`](/docs/sdk/environment-variables#inngest-log-level) if set. See [logging guide](/docs/guides/logging) for more details.
  </Property>
  <Property name="middleware" type="array" version="v2.0.0+">
    A stack of [middleware](/docs/reference/middleware/overview) to add to the client.
  </Property>
  <Property name="env" type="string">
    The environment name. Required only when using [Branch Environments](/docs/platform/environments).
  </Property>
  <Property name="fetch" type="Fetch API compatible interface">
    Override the default [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) implementation. Defaults to the runtime's native Fetch API.
  </Property>
  <Property name="baseUrl" type="string">
    Override the default (`https://inn.gs/`) base URL for sending events. See also the [`INNGEST_BASE_URL`](/docs/sdk/environment-variables#inngest-base-url) environment variable.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Callout>
We recommend setting the [`INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`](/docs/sdk/environment-variables#inngest-event-key) as an environment variable over using the `eventKey` option. As with any secret, it's not a good practice to hard-code the event key in your codebase.
</Callout>

## Defining Event Payload Types

You can leverage TypeScript or Zod to define your event payload types. When you pass types to the Inngest client, events are fully typed when using them with `inngest.send()` and `inngest.createFunction()`. This can more easily alert you to issues with your code during compile time.

<CodeGroup forceTabs={true}>
```ts {{ title: "Zod" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest, type LiteralZodEventSchema } from "inngest";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define each event individually
const productPurchasedEvent = z.object({
  name: z.literal("shop/product.purchased"),
  data: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
});

// You can use satisfies to provide some autocomplete when writing the event
const productViewedEvent = z.object({
  name: z.literal("shop/product.viewed"),
  data: z.object({ productId: z.string() }),
}) satisfies LiteralZodEventSchema;

// Or all together in a single object
const eventsMap = {
  "app/account.created": {
    data: z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
    }),
  },
  "app/subscription.started": {
    data: z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
      planId: z.string(),
    }),
  },
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  schemas: new EventSchemas()
    .fromZod([productPurchasedEvent, productViewedEvent])
    .fromZod(eventsMap),
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Union" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type AppAccountCreated = {
  name: "app/account.created";
  data: {
    userId: string;
  };
};

type AppSubscriptionStarted = {
  name: "app/subscription.started";
  data: {
    userId: string;
    planId: string;
  };
};

type Events = AppAccountCreated | AppSubscriptionStarted;

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromUnion<Events>(),
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Record"}}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type Events = {
  "app/account.created": {
    data: {
      userId: string;
    };
  };
  "app/subscription.started": {
    data: {
      userId: string;
      planId: string;
    };
  };
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Stacking" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";
import { z } from "zod";

type Events = {
  "app/user.created": {
    data: { id: string };
  };
};

const zodEventSchemas = {
  "app/account.created": {
    data: z.object({
      userId: z.string(),
    }),
  },
};

type AppPostCreated = {
  name: "app/post.created";
  data: { id: string };
};

type AppPostDeleted = {
  name: "app/post.deleted";
  data: { id: string };
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  schemas: new EventSchemas()
    .fromRecord<Events>()
    .fromUnion<AppPostCreated | AppPostDeleted>()
    .fromZod(zodEventSchemas),
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Reusing event types <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

You can use the `GetEvents<>` generic to access the final event types from an Inngest client.

<Callout>
It's recommended to use this instead of directly reusing your event types, as Inngest will add extra properties and internal events such as `ts` and `inngest/function.failed`.
</Callout>

```ts
import { EventSchemas, Inngest, type GetEvents } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<{
    "app/user.created": { data: { userId: string } };
  }>(),
});

type Events = GetEvents<typeof inngest>;
type AppUserCreated = Events["app/user.created"];
```

For more information on this and other TypeScript helpers, see [TypeScript - Helpers](/docs/typescript#helpers).

## Best Practices

### Share your client across your codebase

Instantiating the `Inngest` client in a single file and sharing it across your codebase is ideal as you only need a single place to configure your client and define types which can be leveraged anywhere you send events or create functions.

<CodeGroup filename="./inngest/client.ts">
```ts  {{ title: "v3" }}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });
```
```ts  {{ title: "v2" }}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });
```
</CodeGroup>

```ts  {{ filename: './inngest/myFunction.ts' }}
import { inngest } from "./client";

export default inngest.createFunction(...);
```

### Handling multiple environments with middleware

If your client uses middleware, that middleware may import dependencies that are not supported across multiple environments such as "Edge" and "Serverless" (commonly with either access to WebAPIs or Node).

In this case, we'd recommend creating a separate client for each environment, ensuring Node-compatible middleware is only used in Node-compatible environments and vice versa.

This need is common in places where function execution should declare more involved middleware, while sending events from the edge often requires much less.

<CodeGroup filename="./inngest/client.ts">
```ts  {{ title: "v3" }}
// inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { nodeMiddleware } from "some-node-middleware";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
  middleware: [nodeMiddleware],
});

// inngest/edgeClient.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app-edge",
});
```
```ts  {{ title: "v2" }}
// inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { nodeMiddleware } from "some-node-middleware";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My App",
  middleware: [nodeMiddleware],
});

// inngest/edgeClient.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "My App (Edge)",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Also see [Referencing functions](/docs/functions/references), which can help you invoke functions across these environments without pulling in any dependencies.
