# Quick start

This guide will teach you how to add Inngest to a FastAPI app and run an Inngest function.

<Callout variant="info">
  üí° Inngest currently supports Django, FastAPI, Flask, and Tornado. If you'd like support for your favorite framework please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-py)!

## Create an app

<Callout variant="warning">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Python 3.10 or higher.
</Callout>

Create and source virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install fastapi inngest uvicorn
```

Create a FastAPI app file:

```py {{ filename: "main.py" }}
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
```

---

## Add Inngest

Let's add Inngest to the app! We'll do a few things
1. Create an **Inngest client**, which is used to send events to an Inngest server.
1. Create an **Inngest function**, which receives events.
1. Serve the **Inngest endpoint** on the FastAPI app.

```py {{ filename: "main.py" }}
from fastapi import FastAPI
import inngest
import inngest.fast_api

# Create an Inngest client
inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(
    app_id="fast_api_example",
    logger=logging.getLogger("uvicorn"),
)

# Create an Inngest function
@inngest_client.create_function(
    fn_id="my_function",
    # Event that triggers this function
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="app/my_function"),
)
async def my_function(ctx: inngest.Context, step: inngest.Step) -> str:
    ctx.logger.info(ctx.event)
    return "done"

app = FastAPI()

# Serve the Inngest endpoint
inngest.fast_api.serve(app, inngest_client, [my_function])
```

Start your app:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Run Inngest Dev Server

Inngest functions are run using an **Inngest server**. For this guide we'll use the [Dev Server](https://github.com/inngest/inngest), which is a single-binary version of our [Cloud](https://app.inngest.com) offering. The Dev Server is great for local development and testing, while Cloud is for deployed apps (e.g. production).

Start the Dev Server:
```sh
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

After a few seconds, your app and function should now appear in the Dev Server UI:

<Callout variant="info">
  üí° You can sync multiple apps and multiple functions within each app.
</Callout>

## Run your function

Click the function's "Trigger" button and a run should appear in the Dev Server stream tab:
