# Send events

<Callout variant="info">
    💡️ This guide is for sending events from *outside* an Inngest function. To send events within an Inngest function, refer to the [step.send_event](/docs/reference/python/steps/send-event) guide.
</Callout>

Sends 1 or more events to the Inngest server. Returns a list of the event IDs.

```py
import inngest

inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(app_id="my_app")

# Call the `send` method if you're using async/await
ids = await inngest_client.send(
    inngest.Event(name="my_event", data={"msg": "Hello!"})
)

# Call the `send_sync` method if you aren't using async/await
ids = inngest_client.send_sync(
    inngest.Event(name="my_event", data={"msg": "Hello!"})
)

# Can pass a list of events
ids = await inngest_client.send(
    [
        inngest.Event(name="my_event", data={"msg": "Hello!"}),
        inngest.Event(name="my_other_event", data={"name": "Alice"}),
    ]
)
```

## `send`

Only for async/await code.

<Properties>
    <Property name="events" required type="Event | list[Event]">
    1 or more events to send.

    <Properties nested required>
        <Property name="data" type="dict">
            Any data to associate with the event.
        </Property>
        <Property name="id" type="str">
            A unique ID used to idempotently trigger function runs. If duplicate event IDs are seen, only the first event will trigger function runs.
        </Property>
        <Property name="name" required type="str">
            The event name. We recommend using lowercase dot notation for names (e.g. `app/user.created`)
        </Property>
        <Property name="ts" type="int">
            A timestamp integer representing the time (in milliseconds) at which the event occurred. Defaults to the time the Inngest receives the event.

            If the `ts` time is in the future, function runs will be scheduled to start at the given time. This has the same effect as sleeping at the start of the function.
        </Property>
    </Properties>
    </Property>
</Properties>

## `send_sync`

Blocks the thread. If you're using async/await then use `send` instead.

Arguments are the same as `send`.
