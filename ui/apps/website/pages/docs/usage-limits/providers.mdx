# Providers' Usage Limits

As your functions' code runs on the hosting provider of your choice, you will be subject to provider or billing plan
limits separate from [Inngest's own limits](/docs/usage-limits/inngest).

Here are the the known usage limits for each provider we support based on their documentation.
