# Usage Limits

We have put some limits on the service to make sure we provide you a good default to start with, while also keeping it a good experience for all other users using Inngest.

Some of these limits are customizable, so if you need more than what the current limits provide, please [contact us][contact] and we can update the limits for you.

## Functions

The following applies to `step` usage.

**Timeout**

Each step has a timeout depending on the hosting provider of your choice ([see more info][provider-docs]),
but Inngest supports up to `2 hours` at the maximum.

**Concurrency** <Tag>Customizable</Tag>

Our free plan has a concurrency limit of `25`, and paid plans have concurrency limits of `100` (team), `500` (startup), and up to `20,000` (enterprise).

**Payload Size** <Tag>Customizable</Tag>

The limit for data returned by a step is `4MB`.

**# of Steps per Function**

The maximum number of steps allowed per function is `1000`.

<Callout>
  ⚠️
  This limit is easily reached if you're using `step` on each item in a loop.
  Instead we recommend one or both of the following:
  - Process the loop within a `step` and return that data
  - Utilize the [fan out][fanout-guide] feature to process each item in a separate function
</Callout>

## Events

**Name length**

The maximum length allowed for an event name is `256` characters.

**Request Body Size** <Tag>Customizable</Tag>

The limit for each event request is `512KB`, though this can be increased up to `3MB` on request.

**# of Events per request** <Tag>Customizable</Tag>

Maximum number of events you can send in one request is `5000`.
If you're doing fan out, you'll need to be aware of this limitation when you run `step.sendEvent(events)`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
// this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
const events = [{name: "<event-name>", data: {}}, ...];

await step.sendEvent("send-example-events", events);
// or
await inngest.send(events);;
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
// this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
const events = [{name: "<event-name>", data: {}}, ...];

await step.sendEvent(events);
// or
await inngest.send(events);;
```
