It's very common to need to run code at a specific time, across any type of app.  For example, you might want to send appointment reminders 10 minutes before the event, send emails at a specific time, or make blog posts live according to a user-specified date.

Job systems allow you to specify the time that a code should run when you enqueue the job.  Within Inngest, jobs run automatically when an event is received.  How can you schedule work to run at a specific time?

The answer is: pass the date and time that you want the event to run at within the event itself.  Within your function, you can `sleep` or `sleepUntil` the date within the event.

## How to implement this pattern

In order to run code at a specific time based off of event data, first make sure that you send your desired time in the event:

```typescript
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

// Create a new client
const inngest = new Inngest("API");

// Send an event with the time to schedule a blog post in the event data.
inngest.send({
  name: "blog/post.scheduled",
  data: {
    scheduleAt: "2023-04-01T12:30:00.000Z",
    postID: "ed6f81",
  },
});
```

Then, within your function, you can pause until the time in the event:

```typescript
import { createStepFunction } from "inngest";

const delayed = createStepFunction("blog/post.scheduled", ({ event, tools }) => {
  const at = new Date(event.data.scheduleAt);

  // Use the built-in `sleepUntil` tool to sleep until the time in the event.
  // This function will pause then resume running the code below at the given time.
  tools.sleepUntil(at);

  tools.run("Publish post", () => {
    // Any code here runs at the time in the event.
    schedulePost(event.data.postID);
  });
});
```

This function runs immediately when the `blog/post.scheduled` event is received, then pauses until the time and date within the event.  This lets you create a single function that can schedule work at any time using data from the event, intsead of hard-coding times within your code.

You can also cancel these scheduled functions using [the cancellation pattern](/patterns/cancelling-scheduled-functions).
