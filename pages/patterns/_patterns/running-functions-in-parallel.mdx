Event-driven systems allow you to have multiple subscribers for a single event stream.  This lets you [fan-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)#Message-oriented_middleware) an event to multiple functions in parallel.

This is different to how most queueing systems work.  In most queueing systems like SQS or Celery, a specific job in a queue runs a single function.

If you want to run 5 background jobs after a user signs up, using an event-driven system like Inngest you'll only have to send a single event.  In typical queueing systems you'll have to enqueue each 5 different messages individually.

## How to implement this pattern

Inngest allows you to create as many functions as you need which subscribe to the same event:

```typescript
import { createFunction } from "inngest";

const funcA = createFunction("user/signup", ({ event }) => { /* Your logic runs on signup here */ });
const funcB = createFunction("user/signup", ({ event }) => { /* And this function runs in parallel on signup */ });
const funcC = createFunction("user/signup", ({ event }) => { /* This function _also_ runs at the same time */ });
```

In this example, we define three functions which run automatically in parallel whenever the `user/signup` event is received.  Each of these run independently, and can be defined in different projects - without worrying about managing queues or subscribers.

**Alternative event-driven systems**

You can create an event-driven system using things like NATS, Redis, or Kafka - all are reliable event streaming infrastructure components.

Using this infrastructure, you'll need to configure your topics via code (or terraform), then configure stateful subscribers which listen to your topics using an always-alive service.  Your subscribers should handle parallelism themselves, ensuring that you [ack/nack](https://docs.nats.io/legacy/stan/streaming/acks) events as they're processed.  If a single subscription fails, you'll need to manage retries, dead-letter queues, and watermarks for a topic yourself. This is a common approach, though it's often a lot of work to build, set up, and maintain.
