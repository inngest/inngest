## Introduction to Inngest

Inngest is an event-driven durable workflow engine that enables you to run reliable code on any platform, including serverless.

With any Inngest SDK, you write <CodeBracketSquareIcon className="h-4 inline" style={{ marginTop: "-2px" }}/> **Functions** in your codebase and make them available to Inngest using an HTTP endpoint. Functions are triggered by <EventIcon className="inline" style={{ marginTop: "-2px" }}/> **Events** which can be sent with our SDKs, via a regular POST request, or can come from an external source such as webhooks.

Functions are composed of <StepsIcon className="h-4 inline" style={{ marginTop: "-2px" }}/> **Steps**, which decouple parts of your functions into individually retriable blocks. Steps enable you to write complex, durable, long-lived workflows in a single function, on any platform: servers, serverless, or edge.
