# TypeScript

The Inngest SDK leverages the full power of TypeScript, providing you with some awesome benefits when handling events:

- 📑 **Autocomplete**<br/>
  <kbd className="dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-white shadow-none border border-slate-600">Tab ↹</kbd> your way to victory with inferred types for every event.
- **Instant feedback**<br/>
  Understand exactly where your code might <span className="error-text">error</span> before you even save the file.

All of this comes together to provide some awesome type inference based on your actual production data.

## Using types

Once your types are generated, there are a few ways we can use them to ensure our functions are protected.

### `new Inngest()` client

We can use these when creating a new Inngest client via `new Inngest()`.

This comes with powerful inference; we autocomplete your event names when selecting what to react to, without you having to dig for the name and data.

<CodeGroup forceTabs filename="inngest/client.ts">
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type UserSignup = {
  data: {
    email: string;
    name: string;
  };
};
type Events = {
  "user/new.signup": UserSignup;
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type UserSignup = {
  data: {
    email: string;
    name: string;
  };
};
type Events = {
  "user/new.signup": UserSignup;
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My App",
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});
```
</CodeGroup>


```ts {{ filename: "inngest/sendWelcomeEmail.ts" }}
import { inngest } from "./client";

export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-welcome-email" },
  { event: "user/new.signup" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    // "event" is fully typed to provide typesafety within this function
    return await email.send("welcome", event.data.email);
  }
);
```

### Sending events

TypeScript will also enforce your custom events being the right shape - see [Event Format](/docs/reference/events/send) for more details.

We recommend putting your `new Inngest()` client and types in a single file, i.e. `/inngest/client.ts` so you can use it anywhere that you send an event.

Here's an example of sending an event within a Next.js API handler:

```ts {{ filename: "pages/api/signup.ts" }}
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const user = createNewUser(req.body.email, req.body.password, req.body.name);

  // TypeScript will now warn you if types do not match for the event payload
  // and the user object's properties:
  await inngest.send({
    name: "user/new.signup",
    data: {
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name,
    }
  });
  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
}
```

### Using with `waitForEvent`

When writing step functions, you can use `waitForEvent` to to, pause the current function until another event is received or the timeout expires - whichever happens first. When you declare your types using the `Inngest` constructor, `waitForEvent` leverages any types that you have:

<CodeGroup forceTabs filename="inngest/client.ts">
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type UserSignup = {
  data: {
    email: string;
    user_id: string;
    name: string;
  };
};
type UserAccountSetupCompleted = {
  data: {
    user_id: string;
  };
};
type Events = {
  "user/new.signup": UserSignup;
  "user/account.setup.completed": UserAccountSetupCompleted;
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { EventSchemas, Inngest } from "inngest";

type UserSignup = {
  data: {
    email: string;
    user_id: string;
    name: string;
  };
};
type UserAccountSetupCompleted = {
  data: {
    user_id: string;
  };
};
type Events = {
  "user/new.signup": UserSignup;
  "user/account.setup.completed": UserAccountSetupCompleted;
};

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My App",
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});
```

  async ({ event, step }) => {

      return await email.send("welcome", event.data.email);
    });

    // We wait up to 2 days for the user to set up their account
