# Advanced: Middleware <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

<Callout>
Middleware is still pre-release. You can use it by installing v2.0.0 using the `next` tag.

<CodeGroup forceTabs>
```sh {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest@next
```
```sh {{ title: "pnpm " }}
pnpm install inngest@next
```
```sh {{ title: "Yarn" }}
yarn add inngest@next
```
</CodeGroup>
</Callout>

Middleware allows you to specify functions to run at various points in an Inngest client's lifecycle, such as during a function's execution or when sending an event. Use the `InngestMiddleware` class to define new middleware.

```ts
import { Inngest, InngestMiddleware } from "inngest";

const myMiddleware = new InngestMiddleware({
  name: "My Middleware",
  init() {
    return {
      onFunctionRun({ fn }) {
        // This will be logged whenever a function is executed
        console.log(`Function ${fn.name} is running!`);

        // This is where you can optionally specify hooks for this particular run
        return {
          afterExecution() {
            console.log(`Function ${fn.name} has finished running!`);
          },
        };
      },
    };
  },
});

const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My App",
  middleware: [myMiddleware],
});
```

This can be used for a wide range of uses, for example:

- Utilizing error-monitoring libraries (e.g. [Sentry](https://sentry.io/))
- Adding logging support
- Transforming input and output data (e.g. [superjson](https://github.com/blitz-js/superjson))
- Setting up DB connections before starting a function's execution
- Using Inngest's `step` building blocks to build reusable patterns
