# TypeScript with Middleware <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

<Callout>
Middleware is still pre-release. You can use it by installing v2.0.0 using the `next` tag.

<CodeGroup forceTabs>
```sh {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest@next
```
```sh {{ title: "pnpm " }}
pnpm install inngest@next
```
```sh {{ title: "Yarn" }}
yarn add inngest@next
```

Some lifecycle hooks can be used to mutate both values and types at key points in a particular lifecycle. The SDK leverages TypeScript's inference powers to make writing middleware easy for both the developer and the user.

## Mutating input

We can alter the input arguments for a function run (event data, `step` tooling, etc.), using `onFunctionRun`'s `transformInput()` hook. (See [Middleware - Lifecycle - Hook reference](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#hook-reference) for a list of all available hooks.)

```ts {{ title: "inngest/middleware/inputAlteration.ts" }}
new InngestMiddleware({
  name: "Input Alteration",
  init() {
    return {
      onFunctionRun() {
        return {
          transformInput() {
            return {
              ctx: {
                /**
                 * This is a new property that will appear in my function.
                 */
                foo: "bar",
              },
            };
          },
        };
      },
    };
  },
});
```

```ts {{ title: "inngest/fns/myFunction.ts" }}
inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "Example function" },
  { event: "app/user.created" },
  async ({ event, foo }) => {
    //             ^? (parameter) foo: string
  }
);
```

As you can see above, all of our functions now have access to the `foo` variable within our function's input, including typing from the SDK inferring the alterations.

We can use this pattern to add additional typed tooling to function runs.

## Ordering middleware and types

Middleware runs in the order specified when registering it (see [Middleware - Lifecycle - Registering and order](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#registering-and-order)), which affects typing too.

When inferring a mutated input or output, the SDK will apply changes from each middleware in sequence, just as it will at runtime. This means that for two middlewares that add a `foo` value to input arguments, the last one to run will be what it seen both in types and at runtime.
