# Send event

Sends 1 or more events to the Inngest server. Returns a list of the event IDs.

```py
@inngest.create_function(
    fn_id="my_function",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="app/my_function"),
)
async def fn(
    ctx: inngest.Context,
    step: inngest.Step,
) -> list[str]:
    return await step.send_event("send", inngest.Event(name="foo"))
```

## Configuration

<Properties>
    <Property name="step_id" required type="str">
        Step ID. Should be unique within the function.
    </Property>

    <Property name="events" required type="Event | list[Event]">
        1 or more events to send.

        <Properties nested required>
            <Property name="data" type="dict">
                Any data to associate with the event.
            </Property>
            <Property name="id" type="str">
                A unique ID used to idempotently trigger function runs. If duplicate event IDs are seen, only the first event will trigger function runs.
            </Property>
            <Property name="name" required type="str">
                The event name. We recommend using lowercase dot notation for names (e.g. `app/user.created`)
            </Property>
            <Property name="ts" type="int">
                A timestamp integer representing the time (in milliseconds) at which the event occurred. Defaults to the time the Inngest receives the event.

                If the `ts` time is in the future, function runs will be scheduled to start at the given time. This has the same effect as sleeping at the start of the function.
