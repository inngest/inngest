# Create Function

Define your functions using the `createFunction` method on the [Inngest client](/docs/reference/client/create).

```ts
import { inngest } from "./client";

export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "import-product-images" },
  { event: "shop/product.imported" },
  async ({ event, step, runId }) => {
    // Your function code
  }
);
```

## `inngest.createFunction(configuration, trigger, handler): InngestFunction`

The `createFunction` method accepts a series of arguments to define your function.

### Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string" required>
    A unique identifier for your function. This should not change between deploys.
  </Property>
  <Property name="name" type="string">
    A name for your function. If defined, this will be shown in the UI as a friendly display name instead of the ID.
  </Property>

  <Property name="concurrency" type="number | object | [object, object]">

      </Property>
      <Property name="key" type="string">
        A unique key expression for which to restrict concurrently running steps to. The expression is evaluated for each triggering event and a unique key is generate. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info.

    </Properties>
  </Property>

  <Property name="idempotency" type="string">

    Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info. Examples:

    * Only run once for each customer id: `'event.data.customer_id'`

### Trigger

One of the following function triggers is **Required**.

<Properties>
  <Property name="event" type="string">
    The name of the event that will trigger this event to run
  </Property>
  <Property name="cron" type="string">
    A [unix-cron](https://crontab.guru/) compatible schedule string. <br/>Optional timezone prefix, e.g. `TZ=Europe/Paris 0 12 * * 5`.
  </Property>
</Properties>

When using an `event` trigger, you can optionally combine it with the `if` option to filter events:

<Properties nested={true} name="Additional options">
  <Property name="if" type="string">
    A comparison expression that returns true or false whether the function should handle or ignore a given matching event.

    Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info. Examples:

    * `'event.data.action == "published"'`
    * `'event.data.priority >= 4'`
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Handler

The handler is your code that runs whenever the trigger occurs. Every function handler receives a single object argument which can be deconstructed. The key arguments are `event` and `step`. Note, that scheduled functions that use a `cron` trigger will not receive an `event` argument.

```ts
function handler({ event, events, step, runId, logger, attempt }) {/* ... */}
```

#### `event`

The event payload `object` that triggered the given function run. The event payload object will match what you send with [`inngest.send()`](/docs/reference/events/send). Below is an example event payload object:

```ts
{
  name: "app/account.created",
  data: {
    userId: "1234567890"
  },
  v: "2023-05-12.1",
  ts: 1683898268584
}
```

#### `events` <VersionBadge version="v2.2.0+" />

`events` is an array of `event` payload objects that's accessible when the `batchEvents` is set on the function configuration.
If batching is not configured, the array contains a single event payload matching the `event` argument.

#### `step`

The `step` object has methods that enable you to define

- [`step.run()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-run) - Run synchronous or asynchronous code as a retryable step in your function
- [`step.sleep()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep) - Sleep for a given amount of time
- [`step.sleepUntil()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep-until) - Sleep until a given time
- [`step.invoke()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-invoke) - Invoke another Inngest function as a step, receiving the result of the invoked function
- [`step.waitForEvent()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event) - Pause a function's execution until another event is received
- [`step.sendEvent()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-send-event) - Send event(s) reliability within your function. Use this instead of `inngest.send()` to ensure reliable event delivery from within functions.

#### `runId`

The unique ID for the given function run. This can be useful for logging and looking up specific function runs in the Inngest dashboard.

#### `logger` <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

The `logger` object exposes the following interfaces.

```ts
export interface Logger {
  info(...args: any[]): void;
  warn(...args: any[]): void;
  error(...args: any[]): void;
  debug(...args: any[]): void;
}
```

It is a proxy object that is either backed by `console` or the logger you provided ([reference](/docs/guides/logging)).

### `attempt` <VersionBadge version="v2.5.0+" />

The current zero-indexed attempt number for this function execution. The first attempt will be 0, the second 1, and so on. The attempt number is incremented every time the function throws an error and is retried.
