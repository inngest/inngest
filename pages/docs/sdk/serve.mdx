# Serving the Inngest API

Inngest works by serving an HTTP API endpoint which exposes your functions for us to call on-demand.
The first thing you'll need to do is to add and serve the Inngest API in your project.

## Setting up the API

Inngest provides a `serve()` handler which adds an API endpoint to your router.  **You should always
serve our API at `/api/inngest`**, as this makes automated deploys much easier.  If you need to
change the API URL skip to [configuring the API Path](/docs/reference/serve#serve-client-functions-options).

```typescript
// All serve handlers have the same arguments:
serve(
  inngest,    // a client created with new Inngest()
  [fnA, fnB], // an array of Inngest functions to serve, created with inngest.createFunction()
  {/* Optional extra configuration */}
)
```

We provide framework-specific bindings to make this easy for common platforms:

- [AWS Lambda](#framework-aws-lambda)
- [Cloudflare](#framework-cloudflare)
- [DigitalOcean functions](#framework-digital-ocean-functions)
- [Express](#framework-express)
- [Fastify](#framework-fastify)
- [Fresh (Deno)](#framework-fresh-deno)
- [Google Cloud Functions](#framework-google-cloud-functions)
- [H3](#framework-h3)
- [Next.js](#framework-next-js)
- [Redwood](#framework-redwood)
- [Remix](#framework-remix)
- [Custom](#custom-frameworks)

Each of these bindings wrap our base API which implemnts the core logic, so adding support for new
frameworks is easy.  [Want us to add support for another platform?  Come say hi in our discord](/discord)

## Signing key

You'll need to assign your signing key to an `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable in your hosting
provider or `.env` file locally.  This lets the SDK securely communicate with Inngest.  If you can't
provide this as a signing key, you can pass it in to `serve` when setting up your framework.  [Read
the reference for more information](/docs/sdk/reference/serve#reference).

## Framework: AWS Lambda <VersionBadge version="v1.5.0+" />

We recommend using [Lambda function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) to trigger your functions, as these require no other configuration or cost.

Alternatively, you can use an API Gateway to route requests to your Lambda. The handler supports [API Gateway V1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) and [API Gateway V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html). If you are running API Gateway behind a proxy or have some other configuration, you may have to specify the `serveHost` and `servePath` options when calling `serve()` to ensure Inngest knows the URL where you are serving your functions. See [Configuring the API path](/docs/reference/serve#serve-client-functions-options) for more details.

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/lambda";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import fnA from "./fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```

## Framework: Cloudflare

You can import the Inngest API server when using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare pages functions</a> or workers within `/functions/api/inngest.js`:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/cloudflare";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const onRequest = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```


## Framework: DigitalOcean Functions

The DigitalOcean serve function allows you to deploy Inngest to DigitalOcean serverless functions.
Because DigitalOcean doesn't provide the request URL in its function arguments, you **must** include
the function URL and path when configuring your handler:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/digitalocean";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

const main = serve(
  inngest,
  [fnA],
  {
    // Your digitalocean hostname.  This is required otherwise your functions won't work.
    serveHost: "https://faas-sfo3-your-url.doserverless.co",
    // And your DO path, also required.
    servePath: "/api/v1/web/fn-your-uuid/inngest",
  }
);

// IMPORTANT: Makes the function available as a module in the project.
// This is required for any functions that require external dependencies.
module.exports.main = main;
```

## Framework: Express

You can serve Inngest functions within your existing Express app, deployed to any hosting provider
like render, fly, AWS, K8S, etc:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

// Important:  ensure you add JSON middleware to process incoming JSON POST payloads.
app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  // Expose the middleware on our recommended path at `/api/inngest`.
  "/api/inngest",
  serve(inngest, [fnA])
);
```

You must ensure you're using the `express.json()` middleware otherwise your functions won't be
executed.

## Framework: Fastify <VersionBadge version="v2.6.0+" />

You can serve Inngest functions within your existing Fastify app.

We recommend using the exported `inngestFastify` plugin, though we also expose a generic `serve()` function if you'd like to manually create a route.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "Plugin" }}
import Fastify from "fastify";
import inngestFastify from "inngest/fastify";
import { inngest, fnA } from "./inngest";

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.register(inngestFastify, {
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
  options: {},
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Custom route" }}
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { serve } from "inngest/fastify";
import { inngest, fnA } from "./inngest";

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.route({
  method: ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
  handler: serve(inngest, [fnA]),
  url: "/api/inngest",
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Framework: Fresh (Deno)

Inngest works with Deno's <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh
framework</a> via the `esm.sh` CDN.  Add the serve handler to `./api/inngest.ts` as follows:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://esm.sh/inngest/deno/fresh";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client.ts";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```

## Framework: Google Cloud Functions

Google's [Functions Framework](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-nodejs) has an Express-compatible API which enables you to use the Express serve handler to deploy your functions to Google's Cloud Functions or Cloud Run. This is an example of a function

```typescript
import * as ff from "@google-cloud/functions-framework";
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

ff.http('inngest', serve(inngest, [fnA]));
```

You can run this locally with `npx @google-cloud/functions-framework --target=inngest` which will serve your Inngest functions on port `8080`.

## Framework: H3 <VersionBadge version="v2.7.0+" />

Inngest supports [H3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) and frameworks built upon it. Here's a simple H3 server that hosts serves an Inngest function.

<CodeGroup filename="index.js">
```typescript
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { createApp, eventHandler, toNodeListener } from "h3";
import { serve } from "inngest/h3";
import { inngest } from "./inngest/client";
import fnA from "./inngest/fnA";

const app = createApp();
app.use("/api/inngest", eventHandler(serve(inngest, [fnA])));

createServer(toNodeListener(app)).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [github.com/unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) repository for more information about how to host an H3 endpoint.

## Framework: Next.js

Inngest has first class support for Next.js API routes, allowing you to easily create the Inngest API.
Add the following within `./pages/api/inngest.ts`:

<CodeGroup filename="pages/api/inngest.ts">
```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export default serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Next.js 13+ <VersionBadge version="v1.8.0+" />

Version 13+ of Next.js uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers), requiring a separate export for each HTTP method the API supports. Inngest requires `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` methods (see [How the API works](#how-the-api-works) below), which you can export via destructuring instead of `export default`:

<CodeGroup filename="src/app/api/inngest/route.ts">
```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own functions

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Streaming <VersionBadge version="v1.8.0+" />

Next.js Edge Functions hosted on [Vercel](/docs/deploy/vercel) can also stream responses back to Inngest, giving you a much higher request timeout of 15 minutes (up from 10 seconds on the Vercel Hobby plan!).

To enable this, set your runtime to `"edge"` (see [Quickstart for Using Edge Functions | Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/quickstart)) and add the `streaming: "allow"` option to your serve handler:

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

export default serve(inngest, [...fns], {
  streaming: "allow",
});
```

For more information, check out the [Streaming](/docs/streaming) page.

## Framework: Nuxt <VersionBadge version="v0.9.2+" />

Inngest has first class support for [Nuxt server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes), allowing you to easily create the Inngest API.
Add the following within `./server/api/inngest.ts`:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/nuxt";
import { inngest } from "~~/inngest/client";
import fnA from "~~/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export default defineEventHandler(
  serve(inngest, [fnA])
);
```

## Framework: Redwood

You can add Inngest to [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/) easily.  Add the following to
`api/src/functions/inngest.ts`:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/redwood";
import { inngest } from "src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(
  inngest,
  [fnA],
  { servePath: "/api/inngest" }
);
```

You should also update your `redwood.toml` to add `apiUrl = "/api"`, ensuring your API is served
at the `/api` root.

## Framework: Remix

You can add Inngest to Remix easily.  Add the following to `./app/routes/api/inngest.ts`:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/remix";
import { inngest } from "~/inngest/client";
import fnA from "~/inngest/fnA";

const handler = serve(inngest, [fnA]);

export { handler as loader, handler as action };
```

### Streaming <VersionBadge version="v2.3.0+" />

Remix Edge Functions hosted on [Vercel](/docs/deploy/vercel) can also stream responses back to Inngest, giving you a much higher request timeout of 15 minutes (up from 10 seconds on the Vercel Hobby plan!).

To enable this, set your runtime to `"edge"` (see [Quickstart for Using Edge Functions | Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/quickstart)) and add the `streaming: "allow"` option to your serve handler:

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

const handler = serve(inngest, [...fns], {
  streaming: "allow",
});
```
