<!-- It would be good if this could include "generated event payloads [using Cue schemas]" -->
We can use the `inngest run` command to execute your function locally against generated event payloads, specific events from the past, or a number of recent events.

We make it easy to test your function locally, not just against dummy data but also _real production data_ in your dev environment. This functionality helps identify potential breaking changes _before_ you make them or gives you confidence that a dangerous change does indeed still work.

## Run your function with dummy data

In its most basic form, you can use `inngest run` to run your function locally against dummy data generated from your event's schema.

```sh
$ inngest run
```

Here, the CLI uses the event triggers defined in the [`inngest.json|cue`](/docs/functions/inngest-json-configuration) file and generates fake events based on the event schema.

<!-- A callout block here stating that you can specify `inngest run --seed` would be ace -->

Dummy data is excellent for testing that your function handles the incoming schema but may not be ideal for functions with many conditional steps, where your actual data shines.

## Replay past events

The true power of `inngest run` is the ability to replay past events from either your production or test workspaces.

```sh
$ inngest run --replay
```

<!-- I like the term "ecosystem", but it's probably a bit inaccurate (and not used anywhere else). -->
This is fantastically useful not only to ensure that a change to a function works as expected, but also when creating brand new functions based on existing events in your ecosystem; you can be sure they'll run as expected in production without code ever leaving your machine.

<!-- A callout to mention it'll default to your test workspace; provide --prod for prod -->

Replaying provides a couple of extra flags for customising the events that will be run.

<!-- Need a link to explain what a trigger is. Could link to inngest.json|cue for now? -->
Note that currently if your function reacts to more than one trigger, you must provide which trigger you want to replay using `--trigger [my-trigger]`

```sh
# Run your function with the last 20 events
$ inngest run --replay [-c/--count] 20

# Run your function with recent events from a specific trigger
$ inngest run --replay --trigger stripe/customer.created
```

## Replay a specific event

<!-- Link here to understand _how they know an event had a problem_. -->
<!-- Dashboard? Alerting? Viewing outputs/errors? -->
If you find an event that was causing problems for your function - or where the output wasn't quite as expected - you can choose to replay that specific event to ensure that the code change you're making is going to fix the issue.

<!-- Too much? 😅 -->
No more testing in production! 🥳

<!-- Definitely need to explain where to find this ID. -->

```sh
$ inngest run --replay --event-id 01G8BG4FT7CZVAD38D4RJNGTT1
```
