# Update your Prisma database from Stripe events

<!-- Insert a short summary of the function. It should be no longer than a single paragraph -->
Run a background job using the [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to create a new entry in the database when a webhook is received from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

‚û°Ô∏è Check out the related guide: [Running Prisma background jobs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/prisma-background-jobs)

<!-- Define a flowchart to visually show how the function will work -->
<!-- https://mermaid.live/ is a great tool for this, and docs are at https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart -->

```

1. Stripe sends `stripe/charge.succeeded` webhook
2. If the relevant user **is not found** in the database:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Return `404` and doesn't retry, allowing you to handle the edge case
3. If the relevant user **is found** in the database:
   - ‚úÖ Create a new charge record

<!-- To go along with the visual diagram, you can optionally add some numbered steps here to show the same flow -->
<!-- This may not always be required or appropriate, e.g. if there are some async actions happening -->

## Usage

<!-- A quick view of how to get started with the template. -->
<!-- The CLI can guide them -->

Use this quickstart with a single CLI command to get started! The CLI will then guide you through running, testing, and deploying to [Inngest Cloud](https://inngest.com/sign-up?ref=github-example).

```sh
npx inngest-cli init --template github.com/inngest/inngest#examples/prisma-typescript-function
```

Next, check out how to [üëâ trigger the function](#triggering-the-function).

## Configuration

<!-- An annotated version of the `inngest.json|cue` file to help the user firm up the understanding of how the config works.-->

Below is the annotated function definition (found at [inngest.json](inngest.json)) to show how the above is defined in config.

```jsonc

```

## Code

This function has a single step: `steps/step-1`, which is triggered by the `stripe/charge.succeeded` event.

<!-- A brief summary of where to find the various steps in the code and any other interesting configuration -->
- ‚û°Ô∏è [**steps/step-1/**](steps/step-1)
  > Finds the relevant user in the database and creates a new charge record if it could be found.

## Triggering the function

<!-- Instructions for how the user should trigger the function from their infrastructure (or source) -->

To receive Stripe events in your Inngest account, you can connect Stripe via OAuth. To do this, [create a new Source](https://app.inngest.com/sources/new#Stripe). This will link your Stripe and Inngest accounts so that we can automatically receive events as they happen.

Alternatively, you can send your own events from [your own apps](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sending-data-via-inngest-sdks) or [any webhook](https://www.inngest.com/docs/event-webhooks) and run any function automatically.
