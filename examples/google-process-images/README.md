# Process images with Google Cloud and Sharp

<!-- Insert a short summary of the function. It should be no longer than a single paragraph -->

When a `user/profile.photo.uploaded` event is received, check that the uploaded image is safe using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision), then resize the images using [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) create a variety of thumbnails.

<!-- Define a flowchart to visually show how the function will work -->

<!-- To go along with the visual diagram, you can optionally add some numbered steps here to show the same flow -->
<!-- This may not always be required or appropriate, e.g. if there are some async actions happening -->

1. `user/profile.photo.uploaded` event is received
2. ‚û°Ô∏è Run [steps/safety-check](steps/safety-check) to check image safety
3. If image **is** deemed safe:
   - ‚úÖ‚û°Ô∏è Run [steps/process](steps/process) to create different image sizes and upload them to Google Cloud Storage
4. If image **is not** deemed safe:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Run [steps/alert](steps/alert) to warn that the user has uploaded something unsafe

## Usage

<!-- A quick view of how to get started with the template. -->
<!-- The CLI can guide them -->

Use this quickstart with a single CLI command to get started! The CLI will then guide you through running, testing, and deploying to [Inngest Cloud](https://inngest.com/sign-up?ref=github-example).

```sh
npx inngest-cli init --template github.com/inngest/inngest#examples/google-process-images
```

Next, check out how to [üëâ test the function](#testing).

## Configuration

<!-- An annotated version of the `inngest.json|cue` file to help the user firm up the understanding of how the config works.-->

Below is the annotated function definition (found at [inngest.json](inngest.json)) to show how the above is defined in config.

```jsonc

        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Code

This function has only a single step: `steps/hello`, which is triggered by the `user/hello` event.

<!-- A brief summary of where to find the various steps in the code and any other interesting configuration -->

- ‚û°Ô∏è [**steps/safety-check/**](steps/safety-check)
  > Using the `url` found in the event, this step will pass it to the Google Cloud Vision API to see if it is deemed safe. If the image is safe, `isSafe: true` will be passed as output to the next step. Otherwise, we'll pass `isSafe: false`.
- ‚û°Ô∏è [**steps/process/**](steps/process)
  > This step will run after [steps/safety-check](steps/safety-check) if the output is `isSafe: true`. It will stream the `url` from the event, pipe it to an image resizer, then pipe it to Google Cloud Storage. It outputs the created thumbnail URLs.
- ‚û°Ô∏è [**steps/alert/**](steps/alert)
  > If [steps/safety-check](steps/safety-check) returned `isSafe: false`, this step will run and output the user that uploaded the unsafe image. You could use this to push a notification to moderators or to flag the account for review.

## Testing

All Inngest functions can be run and tested locally with data from production, snapshots, or generated events. We'll assume you've already cloned the quick-start using the command below.

```sh
npx inngest-cli init --template github.com/inngest/inngest#examples/google-process-images
```

For this quick-start, we're interacting with two Google APIs: [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).

- If you don't have a Google Cloud Platform account yet, see [Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started)
- Enable **Cloud Storage** - https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/storage-component.googleapis.com
- Head over to [Quickstart: Setup the Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup) to get started and create a service account
- Add your service account `.json` file as a local secret using `.env` files
  ```
  node -e "console.log(\"GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=\'\" + JSON.stringify(require(\"./key.json\")) + \"\'\")" > .env
  ```
- ‚úÖ Run `inngest run`

The final command, `inngest run`, will generate test data based on the event's schema (`user/profile.photo.uploaded`). To try this out with some real images, we could:

- `inngest run --snapshot > snapshot.json`
  > Snapshot the generated event data and place it in a file called `snapshot.json`.
- Edit `snapshot.json` and change the `url`
  > You can set it to any public URL to test whether or not it's detected as safe.
- `cat snapshot.json | inngest run`
  > Use the edited snapshot data to test your function.

## Deploying

Deploying to Inngest Cloud is super simple using `inngest deploy`.

- Head over to [Managing Secrets](https://www.inngest.com/docs/cloud/managing-secrets) to see how to add a secret as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to your Inngest Cloud account
- Run `inngest deploy --prod` (or just `inngest deploy` for test env)

## Triggering the function

<!-- Instructions for how the user should trigger the function from their infrastructure (or source) -->

Let's imagine a JavaScript application using the [Inngest JS SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js#readme).

In your `POST /photos` endpoint, you could add the following code:

```js
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

// POST myapp.com/photos
export default function uploadPhoto(req, res) {
  const url = await handlePhotoUpload(req);
  const { email, id: external_id } = req.ctx.user;

  // Send an event to Inngest
  // You can get a Source Key from the sources section of the Inngest app
  const inngest = new Inngest(process.env.INNGEST_SOURCE_API_KEY);

  await inngest.send({
    name: "user/profile.photo.uploaded",
    data: { url },
    user: { external_id, email },
  });
}
```
