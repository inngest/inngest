## Contributions

I am always welcoming contributions of any type. Please open an issue or create a PR if you find an issue with any of the following.

* An issue with Documentation
* You found the documentation lacking in some way

If you have an issue with the package please include the following

* The dialect you are using
* A description of the problem
* A short example of how to reproduce (if applicable)

Without those basics it can be difficult to reproduce your issue locally. You may be asked for more information but that is a good starting point.

### New Features

New features and/or enhancements are great and I encourage you to either submit a PR or create an issue. In both cases include the following as the need/requirement may not be readily apparent.

1. The use case
2. A short example

If you are issuing a PR also also include the following

1. Tests - otherwise the PR will not be merged
2. Documentation - otherwise the PR will not be merged
3. Examples - [If applicable] see example_test.go for examples

If you find an issue you want to work on please comment on it letting other people know you are looking at it and I will assign the issue to you.

If want to work on an issue but dont know where to start just leave a comment and I'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction.
