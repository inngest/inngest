	// NOTE: There is a race condition when flushing blocks:  we may copy a pause
	// into a block, then while writing the block to disk delete/consume a pause
	// that is being written.  In this case the metadata for a block
	// isn't yet in the index. EG:
	//
	// 1. We read the buffer and add to a block
	// 2. And while uploading the block
	// 3. In parallel, we may delete/consume one of the buffer’s pauses
	//
	// Unfortunately, we only write the block to indexes after uploads complete.
	// This means that a pause may exist in a block but have been consumed.
	//
	// This is fine technically speaking:  consuming pauses is idempotent and leases
	// each pause.
	//
	// However, in order to eventually compact we need to handle the “pause not found”
	// case when consuming, and always re-delete the pause.  that’s no big deal, but
	// not the best.
	//
	// In the future, we could add two block indexes:  pending, and stored.  this is a
	// pain, though, because we may die when uploading pending blocks, and that requires
	// a bit of thought to work around, so we’ll just go with double deletes for now,
	// assuming this won’t happen a ton.  this can be improved later.
