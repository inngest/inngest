// Executor manages executing actions.  It interfaces over a state store to save
// action and workflow data once an action finishes or fails.  Once a function
// finishes, its children become available to execute.  This is not handled
// immediately;  instead, the executor returns the children which can be executed.
// The owner of the executor is responsible for managing and calling the next
// child functions.
//
// # Atomicity
//
// Functions in the executor should be considered atomic.  If the context has closed
// because the process is terminating whilst we are executing, completing, or failing
// an action we must wait for the executor to finish processing before quitting. If
// we fail to wait for the executor, workflows may finish prematurely as future
// actions may not be scheduled.
//
// # Running functions
//
// The executor schedules function execution over drivers.  A driver is a runtime-specific
// implementation which runs functions, eg. a docker driver for running contianers,
// or a webassembly driver for wasm runtimes.
//
// Runtimes can be asynchronous.  A docker container may take minutes to run, and
// the connection to docker may be interrupted.  The executor provides functionality
// for storing the outcome of an action via Resume and Fail at any point after an
// action has started.

	// Execute runs the given function via the execution drivers.  If the
	// from ID is "$trigger" this is treated as a new workflow invocation from the
	// trigger, and all functions that are direct children of the trigger will be
	// scheduled for execution.
	//
	// Attempt is the zero-index attempt number for this execution.  The executor
	// needs knowledge of the attempt number to store the error for each attempt,
	// and to figure out whether this is the final retry for determining whether
	// the next error is "finalized".
	//
	// It is important for this function to be atomic;  if the function was scheduled
	// and the context terminates, we must store the output or async data in workflow
	// state then schedule the child functions else the workflow will terminate early.
	//
	// Execution will fail with no response and state.ErrFunctionCancelled if this function
	// run has been cancelled by an external event or process.
