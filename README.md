- Write background jobs and workflows in your existing codebase using the [**Inngest SDK**](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js)
- Run the open source [**Inngest Dev Server**](#the-inngest-dev-server) on your machine for a complete local development experience, with production parity.
- The **Inngest Platform** invokes your code wherever you host it, via HTTPS. Deploy to your existing setup, and deliver products faster without managing infrastructure.

## Overview

Inngest makes it easy to develop serverless workflows in your existing codebase, without any new infrastructure. Inngest Functions are triggered via events &mdash; decoupling your code within your application.

1. You define your Inngest functions using the [Inngest SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) and serve them through a [simple API endpoint](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/serve?ref=github-inngest-readme).
2. Inngest automatically invokes your functions via HTTPS whenever you send events from your application.

Inngest abstracts the complex parts of building a robust, reliable, and scalable architecture away from you, so you can focus on writing amazing code and building applications for your users.

- **Run your code anywhere** - We call you via HTTPS so you can deploy your code to serverless, servers or the edge.
- **Zero-infrastructure required** - No queues or workers to configure or manage &mdash; just write code and Inngest does the rest.
- **Build complex workflows with simple primitives** - [Our SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js) provides easy to learn `step` tools like [`run`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-run?ref=github-inngest-readme), [`sleep`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep?ref=github-inngest-readme), [`sleepUntil`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep-until?ref=github-inngest-readme), and [`waitForEvent`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event?ref=github-inngest-readme) that you can combine using code and patterns that you're used to create complex and robust workflows.

## Quick Start

ðŸ‘‰ [Read the full quick start guide here](https://www.inngest.com/docs/quick-start?ref=github-inngest-readme)

1. [NPM install our SDK for your typescript project](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js): `npm install inngest`
2. Run the Inngest dev server: `npx inngest-cli@latest dev` (This repo's CLI)
3. [Integrate Inngest with your framework in one line](https://www.inngest.com/docs/sdk/serve?ref=github-inngest-readme) via the `serve()` handler
4. [Write and run functions in your existing framework or project](https://www.inngest.com/docs/functions?ref=github-inngest-readme)

Here's an example:

```ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

// This function will be invoked by Inngest via HTTP any time the "app/user.signup"
// event is sent to to Inngest
export default inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "User onboarding communication" },
  { event: "app/user.signup" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("Send welcome email", async () => {
      await sendEmail({
        email: event.data.email,
        template: "welcome",
      });
    });
  }
);

// Elsewhere in your code (e.g. in your sign up handler):

inngest.send({
  name: "app/user.signup",
  data: {
    email: "test@example.com",
  },
});
```

That's it - your function is set up!

## Project Architecture

Fundamentally, there are two core pieces to Inngest: _events_ and _functions_. Functions have several subcomponents for managing complex functionality (eg. steps, edges, triggers), but high level an event triggers a function, much like you schedule a job via an RPC call to a queue. Except, in Inngest, **functions are declarative**. They specify which events they react to, their schedules and delays, and the steps in their sequence.

<br />

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/architecture-0.5.0.png" alt="Open Source Architecture" width="660" />
</p>

Inngestâ€™s architecture is made up of 6 core components:

- **Event API** receives events from clients through a simple POST request, pushing them to the **message queue**.
- **Event Stream** acts as a buffer between the **API** and the **Runner**, buffering incoming messages to ensure QoS before passing messages to be executed.<br />
- A **Runner** coordinates the execution of functions and a specific runâ€™s **State**. When a new function execution is required, this schedules running the functionâ€™s steps from the trigger via the **executor.** Upon each stepâ€™s completion, this schedules execution of subsequent steps via iterating through the functionâ€™s **Edges.**
- **Executor** manages executing the individual steps of a function, via _drivers_ for each stepâ€™s runtime. It loads the specific code to execute via the **DataStore.** It also interfaces over the **State** store to save action data as each finishes or fails.
  - **Drivers** run the specific action code for a step, e.g. within Docker or WASM. This allows us to support a variety of runtimes.
- **State** stores data about events and given function runs, including the outputs and errors of individual actions, and whatâ€™s enqueued for the future.
- **DataStore** stores persisted system data including Functions and Actions version metadata.
- **Core API** is the main interface for writing to the DataStore. The CLI uses this to deploy new functions and manage other key resources.

And, in this CLI:

- The **DevServer** combines all the components and basic drivers for each into a single system which reads all functions from your application running on your machine, handles incoming events via the API and executes functions, all returning a readable output to the developer.

For specific information on how the DevServer works and how it compares to production [read this doc](/docs/DEVSERVER_ARCHITECTURE.md).
