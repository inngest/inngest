        The event-driven queue for any language.<br />
        Created for rapid development speed and a delightful experience.

## Overview

Inngest makes it simple for you to write delayed or background jobs by triggering functions from events ‚Äî decoupling your code from your queue.

At a very high level, Inngest does two things:

- Ingest events from your systems (pun *very* much intended)
- Triggers serverless functions in response to specific events ‚Äî in the background, either immediately or delayed.

By building this way, you:

- Can deploy new functionality immediately, without modifying your app.
- Never have to create individual queues, workers, dispatchers, or queue-specific infrastructure again.
- Get a ton of extra features, such as event schemas, retries, historical replays, blue-green deploys, instant rollbacks, step functions, coordinated functionality etc. for free, without modifying any of your app.
- Decouple your application code from your infrastructure

We‚Äôre open source, committed to preventing vendor-lock in, using simple standards, and build in the open (we like collaboration).  Sound interesting?

## Installing Inngest

Quick start - this downloads inngest for your os+arch into ./inngest:
```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh \
  && sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest
```

**Manually:** by downloading a¬†[pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli/releases)¬†and placing the binary in your path.

<br />

## Trying Inngest

Once you've installed the CLI, you can run `inngest init` to build new functions,  `inngest run` to test them, and `inngest dev` to run the dev server.

- [Quick start docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/quick-start)

<br />

## Example usage

**Send events** to trigger background jobs anywhere in your own app:

```tsx
const host = "http://..."; // The inngest server.

// Send events via a single HTTP POST using any language.  Here's JS:
await fetch(host, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "user/signed.up",
    data: { id: user.id },
    user: { external_id: user.id }
  })
});
```

 

**Run a function** whenever `user/signed.up` is received (created via `inngest init`):

```tsx
import type { EventTriggers } from "./types";

export async function run({ event }: { event: EventTriggers }) {
  const { id } = event.data; // The event data sent above.

  // You can do anything here:  add the user to Stripe, Zendesk, LaunchDarkly,
  // send welcome emails, start a drip campaign - whatever you'd do
  // in the background.
  return { status: 200 };
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "Post-signup",
  "id": "abstract-nitty-a14c1d",
  "triggers": [{ "event": "user/signed.up" }]
}
```

**Deploy the function:**

```tsx
inngest deploy
```

<br />

## Architecture

Fundamentally, there are two core pieces to Inngest: _events_ and _functions_.  Functions have several sub-components for managing complex functionality (eg. steps, edges, triggers), but high level an event triggers a function, much like you schedule a job via an RPC call to a queue.  Except, in Inngest, **functions are declarative**.  They specify which events they react to, their schedules and delays, and the steps in their sequence.

<br />

</p>

Inngest's architecture is made up of 6 core components:

- **Source API** receives events from clients through a simple POST request, pushing them to the **message queue**.
- **Message Queue** acts as an event stream between the **API** and the **Runner**, buffering incoming messages to ensure QoS before passing messages to be executed.<br />
*note: to simplify local environments this is currently absent from the DevServer, but will be included in self-hosting releases as part of the roadmap.*
- A **Runner** coordinates the execution of functions and a specific run‚Äôs **State**.  When a new function execution is required, this schedules running the function‚Äôs steps from the trigger via the **executor.**  Upon each step‚Äôs completion, this schedules execution of subsequent steps via iterating through the function‚Äôs **Edges.**
- **Executor** manages executing the individual steps of a function, via *drivers* for each step‚Äôs runtime.  It loads the specific code to execute via an **Action Loader.**  It also interfaces over the **State** store to save action data as each finishes or fails.
    - **Drivers** run the specific action code for a step, eg. within Docker or WASM.  This allows us to support a variety of runtimes.
- **State** stores data about events and given function runs, including the outputs and errors of individual actions, and what‚Äôs enqueued for the future.
- **Action Loader** loads and returns action definitions for use by the **Executor**. The source can be from disk, memory, or another persisted state.

And, in this CLI:

- The **DevServer** combines all of the components and basic drivers for each into a single system which loads all functions on disk, handles incoming events via the API and executes functions, all returning a readable output to the developer.
