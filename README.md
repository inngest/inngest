        A CLI for event-driven serverless functions
</h1>

<br />


`inngest` allows you to locally build and test **event-driven** serverless functions.  Using this CLI, you can:

- **Scaffold new serverless functions in seconds**
- **Locally run functions** for fast development
- **Test** functions **with live, historical data**
- Deploy functions instantly
- Time-travel and deploy versions as if they existed in the past ðŸ•—ðŸ”™ðŸ•˜

Using events for serverless functions makes development **fast, easy, safe, and fun!**.  Our aim is to make event-driven development _easier than ever_.

Here's a _quick_ demo of scaffolding a new function and running it locally:

<h3 align="center">Installation</h3>
<br />

Quick start:

```bash
# downloads inngest for your os+arch into ./inngest
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inngest/inngest-cli/main/install.sh | sh && \
  sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest
```

<b>Via the install script</b>


1. Run `curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inngest/inngest-cli/main/install.sh | sh` to automatically download the latest binary for your OS and arch
2. Move the new `./inngest` file into your `$PATH` (eg. `mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin`)

<b>Manually</b>

1. Download a [pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli/releases) and place the binary in your path
2. Move the new `./inngest` file into your `$PATH` (eg. `mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin`)

<br />

It's *really easy*:

1. Run `inngest init` to scaffold a new function.  We'll ask you for your *function name*; the *event that triggers the function*; and *the function language*.
2. `cd` into your new function
3. Run `inngest run` to *run your function locally* using data generated from the event definition
4. Run `inngest deploy` to deploy your function.

Here's all of that in a quick video:

<h3 align="center">How it works</h3>
<br />

Inngest changes the way serverless functions are developed, deployed, and triggered.  We believe that event-driven development is a great way to build and architect flexible, maintainable, decoupled systems â€” but it's impossibly hard to do right.

We provide everything you need for killer, world class event-driven systems out of the box.  Here's an overview of how we work:

1. **We provide a central API for publishing events**.  You can send events with a simple HTTP request ([here are the docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs/event-http-api-and-libraries)).
2. **We record all events received in your system**.  This can be from weeks to _years_.
3. **Events trigger serverless functions automatically**.  We automatically trigger serverless functions with events as the request data.

#### Why events?

Using events instead of raw requests allows us to:

1. **Fully-type your event payloads**, with schema versions as each event changes over time
2. **Enforce event schemas if desired**, preventing data issues from causing bugs
4. **Generate an audit trail** of what happened in your system, when, and who was responsible
5. **Automatically retry functions on failure**, improving reliability
6. **Run functions with historic events**, allowing you to deploy functions with old data as if they were deployed in the past
7. **Handle complex multi-step flows**, eg. run a step-function on add to cart; wait for the purchase event;  then run a step on purchase _or a step on timeout_.  This is killer.

Nothing's stopping you from developing regular ol' HTTP based serverless functions using our tooling, either.  You can still build functions intended for AWS Lambda & API gateway using this CLI, getting local testing for free.

<b>Telemetry</b>

Telemtry is currently **extremely limited**. First, some commitments:

- We never track personal information (eg. IP) from the CLI
- We only ever want to record _metrics_ for product improvement
- For example, we want to answer "Is generating test data for XYZ language heavily used?"

We're a small team and want to make sure we're building the right things. You can opt out by exporting `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` before running `inngest`; we will never send requests with this env variable set.
