# Observability & Metrics


With hundreds to thousands of events going through your Inngest Apps, triggering multiple Function runs, getting a clear view of what is happening at any time is crucial.

The Inngest Platform provides observability features for both Events and Function runs, coupled with Event logs and [a detailed Function Run details to inspect arguments and steps timings](/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs).

## Function runs observability

The Functions list page provides the first round of essential information in one place with:

- **Triggers**: Events or Cron schedule
- **Failure rate**: enabling you to quickly identify a surge of errors
- **Volume**: helping in identifying possible drops in processing

![The Functions list page lists all available Functions with essential information such as associated Events, Failure rate and Volume.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/functions-list.png)

## Function metrics

Navigating to a Function displays the Function metrics page, composed of 7 charts:

![Clicking on a Function leads us to the Function view, composed of 7 charts.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-view.png)

All the above charts can be filtered based on a time range (ex: last 24 hours), a specific Function or [App](/docs/platform/manage/apps).

Let's go over each chart in detail:



### Function Status

<Row>

<Col>

![The Function Status chart is a pie chart where each part represents a function status (failed, succeed or cancelled).](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-runs.png)


</Col>

<Col>

<div className="pt-5">

The Function Status chart provides a snapshot of the number of Function runs grouped by status.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

This chart is the quickest way to identify an unwanted rate of failures at a given moment.
</Callout>

</div>

</Col>

</Row>


### Failed Functions

<Row>

<Col>


The _Failed Functions_ chart displays the top 6 failing functions with the frequency of failures.


<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

You can leverage this chart to identify a possible elevated rate of failures and quickly access the Function runs details from the "View all" button.

</Callout>

</Col>

</Row>



### Total runs throughput


<Row>

<Col>

![The Total runs throughput is a line chart featuring the total number of Function runs per application.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-throughput.png)

</Col>

<Col>

The _Total runs throughput_ is a line chart featuring the **rate of Function runs started per app**. This shows the performance of the system of how fast new runs are created and are being handled.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

Flow control might intentionally limit throughput, this chart is a great way to visualize it.
</Callout>


</Col>

</Row>


### Total steps throughput


<Row>

<Col>


![The Total steps throughput is a line chart featuring the total number of Function steps running at a given time, per application.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/total-steps-throughput.png)


</Col>

<Col>

The _Total steps throughput_ chart represents **the rate of which steps are executed, grouped by the selected Apps**.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use these charts?**

The _Total steps throughput_ chart is helpful to assess the configuration of your Inngest Functions.

For example, a low _Total steps throughput_ might be linked to a high number of concurrent steps combined with a restrictive concurrency configuration.

</Callout>

</Col>

</Row>


{/* 
### SDK request throughput

<Row>

<Col>

The _SDK request throughput_ chart indicates the throughput at which SDK requests (or steps) are queued and executed, **across all selected Apps**.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

This chart is a useful tool to evaluate in the requests sent by the Inngest Platform matches the number of steps created by Functions runs.

The _SDK request throughput_ chart is also useful to evaluate the number of requests sent to your application over time.

</Callout>

</Col>

<Col>

![The SDK request throughput is a line chart featuring three series: queued, started and ended Function runs.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-sdk-request-throughput.png)


</Col>

</Row> */}



### Backlog

<Row>

<Col>


![The_Backlog highlights the number of Function runs waiting to processed at a given time bucket.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/backlog.png)

</Col>

<Col>

The _Backlog_ highlights the number of **Function runs waiting to processed at a given time bucket, grouped by the selected Apps**.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

This chart is useful to assess the _Account Concurrency_ capacity of your account and to identify potential spikes of activity.

</Callout>


</Col>

</Row>

{/* 

### Account concurrency

<Row>

<Col>

The _Account concurrency_ displays the **[concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) usage in time, at the account level**.

The red line illustrates the maximum concurrency capacity of the account.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

This chart is useful to quickly identify is some increase in _Backlog_ or drop in _Total run throughput_ is linked to your account's [concurrency capacity](/docs/guides/concurrency).

Each account gets a maximum concurrency capacity, computed by adding the total number of running steps across all applications.


</Callout>

## Events observability

Events volume and which functions they trigger can become hard to visualize.

Thankfully, the Events page gives you a quick overview of the volume of Events being sent to your Inngest account:

![The Events page lists the available Event type. Each list item features the event name along with its associated Functions and a events volume indicator.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/events-list.png)

Get more detailed metrics for a dedicated event by navigating to it from the list:

## Events metrics and logs

The Event page helps quickly visualize the throughput (the rate of event over time) and functions associated with this event.

The event occurrences feature a “Source” column, which is helpful when an event is triggered from multiple Apps (ex, using different languages):

![Clicking on an Events leads us to the Event page that displays, at the top, a chart of events occurrences over the last 24 hours and at the list of associated events.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/event-view.png)

Clicking on a specific event will redirect you to its Logs.

The Event Logs view provides the most precise information, with the linked Function run and raw event data.

Such information, combined with the ability to forward the event to your Local Dev Server instance, makes debugging events much quicker:

![Clicking on an event of the below list open the Event Logs view, providing much detailed information such as the Event Payload and triggered Functions.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/event-logs-view.png)


## Global Search

The global search feature helps you quickly find apps, functions, and events in your account using their names or **IDs**. It’s more than a search tool — you can also use it to navigate around the environment and take quick actions or access helpful resources.

To open global search, press **Command (⌘) / Ctrl + K** on your keyboard, or click the search icon in the top-left corner.
