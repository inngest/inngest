# Inspecting a Function run

You identified a failed Function run and want to identify the root cause? Or simply want to dig into a run's timings?
The Function run details will provide all the information to understand how this run ran and the tools to reproduce it locally.

## Accessing Function runs

Functions runs across all application of the currently [selected environment](/docs/platform/environments) are accessible via the "Runs" page in the left side navigation.

![The "Handle failed payments" Function runs list features a run in a failing state.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs.png)

_Runs can be filtered using a Status, Queued or Started at and Application filters._

Accessing the runs of a specific Function is achieved via the "Functions" menu, as described in [the function run details section](/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs#the-function-run-details).

## Searching Function runs
Advanced filters are available using a [CEL expression](/docs/guides/writing-expressions). The search feature is available by clicking on the "Show search" button next to the other run filters.

![The runs list features an advance search feature that filters results using a CEL query.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs-search.png)

### Searchable properties
Only basic search operators and `event` and `output` variables are available for now:

|Field name|Type|Operators|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
event.id| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.name| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.ts| `int64`| `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
event.v| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.data| `map[string]any`| `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
output| `any`| `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

A few examples of valid search queries are `event.data.hello == "world"` and `output.success != true`. [Learn more about how expressions are used in Inngest.](/docs/guides/writing-expressions)

<Tip>
  You can combine multiple search queries using the `&&` operator or `||` operator. Adding a new line is the equivalent of using the `&&` operator.
</Tip>

### Searching for errors

Errors are serialized as JSON on the `output` object. When supported by the language SDK, errors are deserialized into a structured object. Here is an example of a error in TypeScript:

```typescript {{ title: "Example TypeScript code" }}
throw new NonRetriableError("Failed to import data");
```

```json {{ title: "Example TypeScript error" }}
{
  "name": "NonRetriableError",
  "message": "Failed to import data",
  "stack": "NonRetriableError: Failed to import data\n    at V1InngestExecution.userFnToRun (/opt/render/project/src/build/inngest/ai.js:143:15) ..."
}
```

This error can be searched using the following CEL expression:

```
output.name == "NonRetriableError" && output.message == "Failed to import data"
```

<Tip>
  Using custom error types in TypeScript can make it easier to search by the type of error:

  <details>
  <summary>Example TypeScript code</summary>

  ```typescript
  import { NonRetriableError } from "inngest";

  class UserNotFoundError extends NonRetriableError {
    constructor(message: string) {
      super(message);
      this.name = "UserNotFoundError";
    }
  }
  inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "my-fn" },
    { event: "user" },
    async ({ step, event }) => {
      await step.run("get-user", async () => {
        const user = await getUser(event.data.userId);
        if (!user) {
          throw new UserNotFoundError(`User not found (${event.data.userId})`);
        }
        // ...
      });
    }
  );
  ```

  ``` {{ title: "Example search query" }}
  event.data.userId == "12345" && output.name == "UserNotFoundError"
  ```
  </details>
</Tip>

## The Function run details
A _Handle failed payments_ function failed after retrying 5 times:


![The "Handle failed payments" Function runs list features a run in a failing state.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/handle-failed-payments-function-run-failed.png)

Clicking on the failed Function Runs expands the run detail view:

![The Function run details view displays the event payload on the left, some technical attributes (function version, timings) on the right and a timeline of steps on the bottom left.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-run-logs.png)

The Function run details panel is divided in 3 parts:

- On the top right: the **Trigger details** helpful when exchanging with Support
- On the right: the **Event payload** that triggered the Function run
- On the bottom right: the **Run details** with its timeline, a clear with of the Function's steps execution


The Function run details informs us that our Function run failed because of an `Error: Failed to downgrade user` error.

This is a first clue, let's have a closer look at the Timeline to identify the root cause:

We can now spot that the `downgrade-account-billing-plan` failed.

Let's expand this step to look at the retries and errors.

Expanding a step provides the same level of details (the error message and timings) along with retries information.

It seems that our `downgrade-account-billing-plan` step raised the same error during the following 5 retries, we might have to perform a fix in the database.

![Clicking on the icon next to "Run details" open it in a new tab with a full-page layout](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs-details-open-new-tab.png)

It is useful for Function having a lot of steps or retries!

## Performing actions from the Function run details

The Function run details provides two main actions: replay the Function Run or sending the trigger event to your local Inngest Dev Server.

Sending the trigger Event to your local Inngest Dev Server provides a quick way to reproduce issues that are not linked to external factors (ex: new function version recently deployed, data issues).

After looking at the Function run details, the failure is judged temporary or fixed by a recent deployment, you can replay the Function run by using the "Rerun" button at the top right of the screen.

![The rerun button is accessible in the header of the "run details" section of the Function run detail](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs-details-open-new-tab.png)
