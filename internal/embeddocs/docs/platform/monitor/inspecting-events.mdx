# Inspecting an Event

The Event details will provide all the information to understand how this event was received, which data it contained and the tools to reproduce it locally.

## Accessing Events

Events across all application of the currently [selected environment](/docs/platform/environments) are accessible via the "Events" page in the left side navigation.

![The Events list features the last events received.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-events/events.png)

_Events can be filtered using a time filter._

Accessing the events of a specific Event Type is achieved via the "Event Types" menu.

## Searching Events
Advanced filters are available using a [CEL expression](/docs/guides/writing-expressions). The search feature is available by clicking on the "Show search" button.

![The events list features an advance search feature that filters results using a CEL query.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-events/events-search.png)

### Searchable properties
Only basic search operators and the `event` variable are available for now:

|Field name|Type|Operators|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
event.id| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.name| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.ts| `int64`| `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
event.v| `string`| `==`, `!=`
event.data| `map[string]any`| `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`

A few examples of valid search queries are `event.data.hello == "world"` and `event.name != "billing"`. [Learn more about how expressions are used in Inngest.](/docs/guides/writing-expressions)

<Tip>
  You can combine multiple search queries using the `&&` operator or `||` operator. Adding a new line is the equivalent of using the `&&` operator.
