# Deployment

Moving to production requires deploying your Inngest Functions on your favorite Cloud Provider and configuring it to allow the Inngest Platform to orchestrate runs:

## How Inngest handles Function Runs


The Inngest Platform hosts the Inngest Durable Execution Engine, responsible for triggering and maintaining the state of **Function runs happening on your Cloud Provider**:

<ImageTheme

  light={'/assets/docs/platform/deployment/Durable-Execution-Engine-triggers-overview-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={'The Inngest Platform communicates with your deployed Inngest Functions by sending requests to your application.'}
/>

The Inngest Platform relies on [Event](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key) and [Signing Keys](/docs/platform/signing-keys), as well as [other security mechanisms](/docs/learn/security), to communicate securely and reliably with the Inngest SDK.

Learn more on Inngest's Durable Execution Engine in our ["How Inngest Functions are executed" guide](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed).
