# Function runs Bulk Cancellation

In addition to providing [SDK Cancellation features](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events) and a [dedicated REST API endpoint](/docs/guides/cancel-running-functions), the Inngest Platform also features a Bulk Cancellation UI.

This feature comes in handy to quickly stop unwanted runs directly from your browser.

## Cancelling Function runs

To cancel multiple Function runs, navigate to the Function's page on the Inngest Platform and open the “All actions” top right menu:

![The bulk cancellation button can be found from a Function page, in the top right menu.](/assets/docs/platform/function-dashboard-actions-2025-05-05.png)

Clicking the “Bulk cancel” menu will open the following modal, asking you to select the date range that will be used to select and cancel Function runs:

![The Bulk cancel modal is composed, from top to bottom, of an input to name the cancellation process and a date range selector. Once those information filled, a estimation of the impacted Function Runs. The cancellation cannot be started if no Function runs match the criteria.](/assets/docs/platform/manage/bulk-cancellation/bulk-cancel-modal.png)

The Bulk Cancellation will start cancelling the matching Function runs immediately; the Function runs list will update progressively, showing runs as cancelled:

![Once the Bulk Cancellation completed, the impacted Function Runs will appear as "cancelled" in the Function Runs list.](/assets/docs/platform/manage/bulk-cancellation/function-runs-cancelled.png)

You can access the history of running or completed Bulk Cancellation processes via the "Cancellation history" tab:

**Considerations**

Cancellation is useful to stop running Functions or cancel scheduled ones; however, keep in mind that:

- Steps currently running on your Cloud Provider won't be forced to stop; the Function will cancel upon the current step's completion.
- Cancelling a Function run does not prevent new runs from being enqueued. If you are looking to mitigate an unwanted loop or to cope with an abnormal number of executions, consider using [Function Pausing](/docs/guides/pause-functions).
