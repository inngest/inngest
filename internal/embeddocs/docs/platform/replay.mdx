# Function Replay

Functions will fail. It's unavoidable. When they do, you need to recover from the failure quickly.

When a large number of functions fail, you can easily _replay_ them in bulk from the Inngest dashboard.

The recovery flow in other systems may require dead-letter queues or some other form of manual intervention.
With Replay, you can replay functions in bulk from the Inngest dashboard:

1. You detect an issue with your functions (e.g. a failure due to a bug or external system)
2. You fix the issue and push to production
3. You use Replay to replay the functions from the time range when the issues occurred

Let's learn how you can use Replay to recover from function failures:

## How to create a new Replay

To replay a function, select the "Replay" option in the "All actions" menu from a function's dashboard. This will open a modal where you can select the runs you want to replay.

Each replay requires a name, a time range and status(es) to filter the runs to be replayed.
We recommend using a name that describes the incident that you're resolving so your team can
understand this later, or maybe just mention the bug tracker issue:  e.g. "Bug fix from PR #958",
"API-395: Networking blip."

Here's an example of a Replay that fixed a bug triggered by daylight savings time between the given timestamp.
For this issue, we only want to target the "Failed" function runs statuses. You can select multiple run
statuses in case your function might have had a bug that failed silently, so you want to replay anything
previously marked as "Succeeded" as well.

Once you have selected the runs you want to replay, click the replay button to start the replay. You
will be redirected to the replay page where you can see the progress of the replay.

The replay will spread out the runs over time as to not overwhelm your application with requests.
Depending on the number of runs to be replayed, this could take seconds or minutes to complete.

When all the runs have been replayed, the replay will be marked as "Completed."
