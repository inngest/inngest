# Prisma Pulse: Trigger Functions from database changes

Prisma Pulse integrates with Inngest, transforming database changes into Inngest Events.

Connecting Prisma Pulse to your database will trigger a new row in the `users` table, creating a `db/user.created` event that can trigger Inngest Functions (*for example, a user onboarding email sequence*).

## Setup Prisma Pulse

Using Prisma Pulse requires some configuration changes on both your Prisma Data Platform account and database.

Please refer to the [Prisma Pulse documentation to enable it](https://www.prisma.io/docs/pulse/getting-started#1-enable-pulse-in-the-platform-console).

## Setup and deploying the Inngest Pulse Router

Once Prisma Pulse enabled on your account, you'll have to deploy a Inngest Pulse Router, responsible for translating Prisma Pulse events into
Inngest events.

The following command will generate for you the Inngest Pulse Router in your application:

```bash
npx try-prisma -t pulse/inngest-router
```

### Configuring the watched tables

The list of watched tables should be configured in the `src/index.ts` file by updating the following list:

```ts {{ filename: 'src/index.ts' }}
// Here configure each prisma model to stream changes from
const PRISMA_MODELS = ['notification', 'user'];
```

### Deploying the Inngest Pulse Router


The Inngest Pulse Router is a Node.js program opening a websocket connection with the Prisma Pulse API.
The following environment variables are required:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- [`PULSE_API_KEY`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/pulse/getting-started#14-generate-an-api-key)
- [`INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key)
- [`INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`](/docs/platform/signing-keys)


Due to its long-lived nature, the Inngest Pulse Router needs to be deployed on a Cloud Provider such as Railway.

**Using Prisma Pulse with Serverless**

The Inngest Pulse Router can also be deployed on Serverless by leveraging the [Delivery Guarantees](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-pulse-introducing-delivery-guarantees-for-database-change-events) of Pulse events.

By passing a `name` to your `prisma.model.stream({ name: "inngest-router" })`, Prisma Pulse will keep track of received events and only send the new ones (since the last connection).

We can leverage this mechanism by creating a Inngest Functions trigger by a CRON schedule and running on a Serverless Function. The Inngest Function will run every 15min and collect the first 100 updates before finishing.

## Trigger a Function from a database event

Once your Inngest Pulse Router deployed, Inngest events matching your database changes will be triggered.

All events follow the following format: `"db/<table>.<action>"` with `<action>` part of:
- `create`
- `update`
- `delete`


The events sent by the Inngest Pulse Router contains the changed data, as described [in this API Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/pulse/api-reference#pulsecreateeventuser).


Here is an example of a onboarding workflow followed upon each new account creation:

```ts {{ filename: 'app/inngest/functions.ts' }}
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/email"

export const handleNewUser = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "handle-new-user" },
  { event: "db/user.create" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // This object includes the entire record that changed
    const pulseEvent = event.data;

    await step.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
  		// Send welcome email
      await sendEmail({
        template: "welcome",
        to: pulseEvent.created.email,
      });
    });

    await step.sleep("wait-before-tips", "3d");

    await step.run("send-new-user-tips-email", async () => {
      // Follow up with some helpful tips
      await sendEmail({
        template: "new-user-tips",
        to: pulseEvent.created.email,
      });
    });
  },
);
```

**Best practice**

A Function run performing a database change might trigger a Prisma Pulse event that will run the Function again.

We recommend using `"db/*"` events in combination with a `if:` filter to avoid any infinite loop of Function runs triggered.
