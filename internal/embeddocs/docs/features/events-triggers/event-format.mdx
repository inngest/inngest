## Event payload format

The event payload is a JSON object that must contain a `name` and `data` property.

### Required properties

* The `name` is the type or category of event. Event `name`s are used to [trigger functions](/docs/functions). For example, `app/user.created` or `billing/invoice.paid`. See [tips for event naming](#tips-for-event-naming) below.
* `data` contains any data you want to associate with the event. This data will be serialized to JSON. For example, if you're sending an event for a paid invoice, you might include the invoice's `id`, the `amount`, and the `customerId` in the `data` property. The `data` property can contain any nested JSON object, including objects and arrays.

### Optional properties

* `id` is a unique identifier for the event used to prevent duplicate events. Learn more about [deduplication](#deduplication).
* `ts` is the timestamp of the event in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. If not provided, the timestamp will be set to the time the event was received by Inngest.
* `v` is the event payload version. This is useful to track changes in the event payload shape over time. For example, `"2024-01-14.1"`
* `user` is object for ease of grouping user-identifying data or attributes associated with the event. This data is encrypted at rest.
  * **NOTE** - We now recommend that developers use [encryption middleware](/docs/features/middleware/encryption-middleware) to store personally identifiable information (PII) within the `data` object. Encryption middleware also has added benefits as it supports full or partial encryption of data returned from steps as well as complete control over the encryption key.

### Tips for event naming

Event names are used to trigger functions. We recommend using a consistent naming convention for your events. This will make it easier to find and trigger functions in the future. Here are some tips for naming events:

* **Object-Action**: Use an Object-Action pattern as represented by noun and a verb. This is great for grouping related events on a given object, `account.created`, `account.updated`, `account.deleted`.
* **Past-tense**: Use a past-tense verb for the action. For example, `uploaded`, `paid`, `completed`, `sent`.
* **Separators**: Use dot-notation and/or underscores to separate words. For example, `user.created` or `blog_post.published`.
* **Prefixes**: Use prefixes to group related events. For example, `api/user.created`, `billing/invoice.paid`, `stripe/customer.created`. This is especially useful if you have multiple applications that send events to Inngest.

There is no right or wrong way to name events. The most important thing is to be consistent and use a naming convention that makes sense for your application.
