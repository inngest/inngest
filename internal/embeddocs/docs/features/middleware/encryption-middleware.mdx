# Encryption Middleware


Encryption middleware provides end-to-end encryption for events, step output, and function output. **Only encrypted data is sent to Inngest servers**: encryption and decryption happen within your infrastructure.

    { key: "typescript", title: "TypeScript (v2.0.0+)" },
    { key: "python", title: "Python (v0.3.0+)" }
  ]}>

## Installation

  <GuideSection show="python">

    The `EncryptionMiddleware` is available as part of the `inngest_encryption` package:

    ```py
    import inngest
    from inngest_encryption import EncryptionMiddleware

    inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(
        app_id="my-app",
        middleware=[EncryptionMiddleware.factory("my-secret-key")],
    )
    ```

    The following data is encrypted by default:
    - The `encrypted` field in `event.data`.
    - `step.run` return values.
    - Function return values.

  </GuideSection>

  <GuideSection show="typescript">

    Install the [`@inngest/middleware-encryption` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/middleware-encryption) ([GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/packages/middleware-encryption#readme)) and configure it as follows:

    ```ts
    import { encryptionMiddleware } from "@inngest/middleware-encryption";

    // Initialize the middleware
    const mw = encryptionMiddleware({
      // your encryption key string should not be hard coded
      key: process.env.MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
    });

    // Use the middleware with Inngest
    const inngest = new Inngest({
      id: "my-app",
      middleware: [mw],
    });
    ```

   By default, the following will be encrypted:
    - All step data
    - All function output
    - Event data placed inside `data.encrypted`

  </GuideSection>


  ## Changing the encrypted `event.data` field

  <GuideSection show="python">
    By default, `event.data.encrypted` is encrypted. All other fields are sent in plaintext. To encrypt a different field, set the `event_encryption_field` parameter.
  </GuideSection>

  <GuideSection show="typescript">
    Only select pieces of event data are encrypted. By default, only the data.encrypted field.

    This can be customized using the `eventEncryptionField: string` setting.
  </GuideSection>

  ## Decrypt only mode


  <GuideSection show="python">
    To disable encryption but continue decrypting, set `decrypt_only=True`. This is useful when you want to migrate away from encryption but still need to process older events.
  </GuideSection>

  <GuideSection show="typescript">
   To disable encryption but continue decrypting, set `decryptOnly: true`. This is useful when you want to migrate away from encryption but still need to process older events.
  </GuideSection>

  ## Fallback decryption keys

  <GuideSection show="python">
    To attempt decryption with multiple keys, set the `fallback_decryption_keys` parameter. This is useful when rotating keys, since older events may have been encrypted with a different key.
  </GuideSection>

  <GuideSection show="typescript">
    To attempt decryption with multiple keys, set the `fallbackDecryptionKeys` parameter. This is useful when rotating keys, since older events may have been encrypted with a different key:

    ```ts
    // start out with the current key
    encryptionMiddleware({
      key: process.env.MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
    });

    // deploy all services with the new key as a decryption fallback
    encryptionMiddleware({
      key: process.env.MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
      fallbackDecryptionKeys: ["new"],
    });

    // deploy all services using the new key for encryption
    encryptionMiddleware({
      key: process.env.MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V2,
      fallbackDecryptionKeys: ["current"],
    });

    // once you are sure all data using the "current" key has passed, phase it out
    encryptionMiddleware({
      key: process.env.MY_ENCRYPTION_KEY_V2,
    });
    ```
  </GuideSection>

  ## Cross-language support

  This middleware is compatible with our encryption middleware in our TypeScript SDK. Encrypted events can be sent from Python and decrypted in TypeScript, and vice versa.
