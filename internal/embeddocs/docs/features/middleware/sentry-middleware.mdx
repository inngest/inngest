# Sentry Middleware


Using the Sentry middleware is useful to:
- Capture exceptions for reporting
- Add tracing to each function run
- Include useful context for each exception and trace like function ID and event names

    The `SentryMiddleware` is shipped as part of the `inngest` package:

    ```py
    import inngest
    from inngest.experimental.sentry_middleware import SentryMiddleware

    import sentry_sdk

    # Initialize Sentry as usual wherever is appropriate
    sentry_sdk.init(
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    )

    inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(
        app_id="my-app",
        middleware=[SentryMiddleware],
    )
    ```
