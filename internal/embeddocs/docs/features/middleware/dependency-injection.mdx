# Using Middleware for Dependency Injection

Inngest Functions running in the same application often need to share common clients instances such as database clients or third-party
libraries.

The following is an example of adding a OpenAI client to all Inngest functions, allowing them immediate access without needing to create the client themselves.

<GuideSelector

    { key: "typescript-middleware", title: "TypeScript (v 3.34.0+)"},

  ]}>
    <GuideSection show="typescript-middleware">
        We can use the `dependencyInjectionMiddleware` to add arguments to a
        function's input.

        Check out the [TypeScript example](?guide=typescript) for a customized middleware.

        ```ts
        import { dependencyInjectionMiddleware } from "inngest";
        import OpenAI from 'openai';

        const openai = new OpenAI();

        const inngest = new Inngest({
          id: 'my-app',
          middleware: [
            dependencyInjectionMiddleware({ openai }),
          ],
        });
        ```

        Our Inngest Functions can now access the OpenAI client through the context:

         ```ts
        inngest.createFunction(
          { name: "user-create" },
          { event: "app/user.create" },
          async ({ openai }) => {
            const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
              messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
              model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            });

            // ...
          },
        );

        ```

        <Callout>
        ðŸ’¡ Types are inferred from middleware outputs, so your Inngest functions will see an appropriately-typed `openai` property in their input.

        ### Advanced mutation

        When the middleware runs, the types and data within the passed `ctx` are merged on top of the default provided by the library. This means that you can use a few tricks to overwrite data and types safely and more accurately.

        For example, here we use a `const` assertion to infer the literal value of our `foo` example above.

        ```ts
        // In middleware
        dependencyInjectionMiddleware({
          foo: "bar",
        } as const)

        // In a function
        async ({ event, foo }) => {
          //             ^? (parameter) foo: "bar"
        }
        ```

        ## Ordering middleware and types

        Middleware runs in the order specified when registering it (see [Middleware - Lifecycle - Registering and order](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#registering-and-order)), which affects typing too.

        When inferring a mutated input or output, the SDK will apply changes from each middleware in sequence, just as it will at runtime. This means that for two middlewares that add a `foo` value to input arguments, the last one to run will be what it seen both in types and at runtime.

    <GuideSection show="typescript">
        Our custom `openaiMiddleware` relies on the [`transformInput` hook](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#on-function-run-lifecycle) to mutate the Function's context:

        ```ts
        import { InngestMiddleware } from "inngest";
        import OpenAI from "openai";

        const openaiMiddleware = new InngestMiddleware({
          name: "OpenAI Middleware",
          init() {
            const openai = new OpenAI();

            return {
              onFunctionRun(ctx) {
                return {
                  transformInput(ctx) {
                    return {
                      // Anything passed via `ctx` will be merged with the function's arguments
                      ctx: {
                        openai,
                      },
                    };
                  },
                };
              },
            };
          },
        });
        ```

        Our Inngest Functions can now access the OpenAI client through the context:

         ```ts
        inngest.createFunction(
          { name: "user-create" },
          { event: "app/user.create" },
          async ({ openai }) => {
            const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
              messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
              model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            });

            // ...
          },
        );

        ```

        Explore other examples in the [TypeScript SDK Middleware examples page](/docs/reference/middleware/examples).

        ### Advanced mutation

        When middleware runs and `transformInput()` returns a new `ctx`, the types and data within that returned `ctx` are merged on top of the default provided by the library. This means that you can use a few tricks to overwrite data and types safely and more accurately.

        For example, here we use a `const` assertion to infer the literal value of our `foo` example above.

        ```ts
        // In middleware
        transformInput() {
          return {
            ctx: {
              foo: "bar",
            } as const,
          };
        }

        // In a function
        async ({ event, foo }) => {
          //             ^? (parameter) foo: "bar"
        }
        ```

        Because the returned `ctx` object and the default are merged together, sometimes good inferred types are overwritten by more generic types from middleware. A common example of this might be when handling event data in middleware.

        To get around this, you can provide the data but omit the type by using an `as` type assertion. For example, here we use a type assertion to add `foo` and alter the event data without affecting the type.

        ```ts
        async transformInput({ ctx }) {
          const event = await decrypt(ctx.event);

          const newCtx = {
            foo: "bar",
            event,
          };

          return {
            // Don't affect the `event` type
            ctx: newCtx as Omit<typeof newCtx, "event">,
          };
        },
        ```

        ## Ordering middleware and types

        Middleware runs in the order specified when registering it (see [Middleware - Lifecycle - Registering and order](/docs/reference/middleware/lifecycle#registering-and-order)), which affects typing too.

        When inferring a mutated input or output, the SDK will apply changes from each middleware in sequence, just as it will at runtime. This means that for two middlewares that add a `foo` value to input arguments, the last one to run will be what it seen both in types and at runtime.

        Our `OpenAIMiddleware` uses the [`transform_input` hook](/docs/reference/python/middleware/lifecycle#transform-input) to inject context:

        ```py
        import inngest
        from openai import OpenAI

        class OpenAIMiddleware(inngest.Middleware):
            def __init__(

                client: inngest.Inngest,
                raw_request: object,
            ) -> None:
                self.openai = OpenAI(
                    # This is the default and can be omitted
                    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
                )

            def transform_input(

            middleware=[OpenAIMiddleware],
