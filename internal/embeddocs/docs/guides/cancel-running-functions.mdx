# Bulk Cancellation

{/* TODO - Link the sleeps and waits to guides when we move those from references to guides */}
With Inngest, your functions can be running or paused for long periods of time. You may have function with hundreds of steps, or you may be using [`step.sleep`](/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep), [`step.sleepUntil`](/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep-until), or [`step.waitForEvent`](/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event). Sometimes, things happen in your system that make it no longer necessary to complete running the function, which is when cancelling is necessary.

Inngest provides both a Bulk Cancellation API and UI. The Bulk Cancellation API offers more flexibility with the support of event expression matching
while the [Bulk Cancellation UI](/docs/platform/manage/bulk-cancellation), available from the Platform, provides a quick way to cancel unwanted Function runs.

## Bulk cancel via the REST API

You can also cancel functions in bulk via the [REST API](https://api-docs.inngest.com/docs/inngest-api). This is useful if you have a large number of functions within a specific range that you need to cancel.

With the `POST /cancellations` endpoint, you can cancel functions by specifying the `app_id`, `function_id`, and a `started_after` and `started_before` timestamp range. You can also optionally specify an `if` statement to only cancel functions that match a [given expression](/docs/guides/writing-expressions).

<CodeGroup tag="POST" label="api.inngest.com/v1/cancellations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -X POST https://api.inngest.com/v1/cancellations \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer signkey-prod-<YOUR-SIGNING-KEY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "app_id": "acme-app",
    "function_id": "schedule-reminder",
    "started_after": "2024-01-21T18:23:12.000Z",
    "started_before": "2024-01-22T14:22:42.130Z",
    "if": "event.data.userId == 'user_o9235hf84hf'"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

When successful, the response will be returned with the cancellation ID and the cancellation job data:

```json {{ title: 'Response' }}
{
  "id": "01HMRMPE5ZQ4AMNJ3S2N79QGRZ",
  "environment_id": "e03843e1-d2df-419e-9b7b-678b03f7398f",
  "function_id": "schedule-reminder",
  "started_after": "2024-01-21T18:23:12.000Z",
  "started_before": "2024-01-22T14:22:42.130Z",
  "if": "event.data.userId == 'user_o9235hf84hf'"
}
```
