# Fan-out (one-to-many)

The fan-out pattern enables you to send a single event and trigger multiple functions in parallel (one-to-many). The key benefits of this approach are:

* **Reliability**: Logic from each function runs independently, meaning an issue with one function will not affect the other(s).
* **Performance**: As functions area run in parallel, all of the work will execute faster than running in sequence.

A use case for fan-out is, for example, when a user signs up for your product. In this scenario, you may want to:
1. Send a welcome email
2. Start a trial in Stripe
3. Add the user to your CRM
4. Add the user's email to your mailing list

The fan-out pattern is also useful in distributed systems where a single event is consumed by functions running in different applications.

## How to fan-out to multiple functions

Since Inngest is powered by events, implementing fan-out is as straightforward as defining multiple functions that use the same event trigger. Let's take the above example of user signup and implement it in Inngest.

First, set up a `/signup` route handler to send an event to Inngest when a user signs up:

```ts {{ filename: "app/routes/signup/route.ts" }}
import { inngest } from '../inngest/client';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // NOTE - this code is simplified for the of the example:
  const { email, password } = await request.json();
  const user = await createUser({ email, password });
  await createSession(user.id);

  // Send an event to Inngest
  await inngest.send({
    name: 'app/user.signup',
    data: {
      user: {
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
      },
    },
  });

  redirect('https://myapp.com/dashboard');
}
```

Now, with this event, any function using `"app/user.signup"` as its event trigger will be automatically invoked.

Next, define two functions: `sendWelcomeEmail` and `startStripeTrial`. As you can see below, both functions use the same event trigger, but perform different work.

```ts {{ filename: "inngest/functions.ts" }}
const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'send-welcome-email' },
  { event: 'app/user.signup' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run('send-email', async () => {
      await sendEmail({ email: event.data.user.email, template: 'welcome');
    });
  }
)

const startStripeTrial = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'start-stripe-trial' },
  { event: 'app/user.signup' },
  async ({ event }) => {
    const customer = await step.run('create-customer', async () => {
      return await stripe.customers.create({ email: event.data.user.email });
    });
    await step.run('create-subscription', async () => {
      return await stripe.subscriptions.create({
        customer: customer.id,
        items: [{ price: 'price_1MowQULkdIwHu7ixraBm864M' }],
        trial_period_days: 14,
      });
    });
  }
)
```

You've now successfully implemented fan-out in our application. Each function will run independently and in parallel. If one function fails, the others will not be disrupted.

Other benefits of fan-out include:

* **Bulk Replay**: If a third-party API goes down for a period of time (for example, your email provider), you can use [Replay](/docs/platform/replay) to selectively re-run all functions that failed, without having to re-run all sign-up flow functions.
* **Testing**: Each function can be tested in isolation, without having to run the entire sign-up flow.
* **New features or refactors**: As each function is independent, you can add new functions or refactor existing ones without having to edit unrelated code.
* **Trigger functions in different codebases**: If you have multiple codebases, even using different programming languages (for example [Python](/docs/reference/python) or [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/inngest/inngestgo)), you can trigger functions in both codebases from a single event.
