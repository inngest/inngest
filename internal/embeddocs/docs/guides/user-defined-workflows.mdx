# Build workflows configurable by your users

Users today are demanding customization and integrations from every product. Your users may want your product to support custom workflows to automate key user actions.
Leverage our [Workflow Kit](/docs/reference/workflow-kit) to add powerful user-defined workflows features to your product.

Inngest's Workflow Kit ships as a full-stack package ([`@inngest/workflow-kit`](https://npmjs.com/package/@inngest/workflow-kit)), aiming to simplify the development of user-defined workflows on both the front end and back end:

  light={'/assets/docs/reference/workflow-kit/workflow-kit-architecture-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={'The Workflow Kit provides a Workflow Engine to compose workflow actions on the back end and a set of pre-defined React components for the front end.'}

  This use case is available a open-source Next.js demo on GitHub.
</Card>
</CardGroup>


Our  Next.js CMS application features the following `blog_posts` table:

|Column name|Column type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
id| `bigint`|
title | `text`| _The title of the blog post_
subtitle | `text`| _The subtitle of the blog post_
status | `text`| _"draft" or "published"_
markdown | `text`| _The content of the blog post as markdown_
created_at | `timestamp`|

<Callout>

You will find a ready-to-use database seed [in the repository](https://github.com/inngest/workflow-kit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-blog-cms/supabase/seed.sql).

</Callout>

We would like to provide the following AI automation tasks to our users:

**Review tasks**
- Add a Table of Contents: _a task leveraging OpenAI to insert a Table of Contents in the blog post_
- Perform a grammar review: _a task leveraging OpenAI to perform some grammar fixes_

**Social content tasks**
- Generate LinkedIn posts: _a task leveraging OpenAI to generate some Tweets_
- Generate Twitter posts: _a task leveraging OpenAI to generate a LinkedIn post_

Our users will be able to combine those tasks to build their custom workflows.

### 1. Adding the tasks definition to the application

After [installing and setup Inngest](/docs/getting-started/nextjs-quick-start?ref=docs-guide-user-defined-workflows) in our Next.js application, we will create the following [Workflow Actions definition](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/actions) file:

```ts {{ title: "lib/inngest/workflowActions.ts" }}
import { type PublicEngineAction } from "@inngest/workflow-kit";

export const actions: PublicEngineAction[] = [
  {
    kind: "add_ToC",
    name: "Add a Table of Contents",
    description: "Add an AI-generated ToC",
  },
  {
    kind: "grammar_review",
    name: "Perform a grammar review",
    description: "Use OpenAI for grammar fixes",
  },
  {
    kind: "wait_for_approval",
    name: "Apply changes after approval",
    description: "Request approval for changes",
  },
  {
    kind: "apply_changes",
    name: "Apply changes",
    description: "Save the AI revisions",
  },
  {
    kind: "generate_linkedin_posts",
    name: "Generate LinkedIn posts",
    description: "Generate LinkedIn posts",
  },
  {
    kind: "generate_tweet_posts",
    name: "Generate Twitter posts",
    description: "Generate Twitter posts",
  },
];

```

  <Card title="Learn more about Workflow Actions" href="/docs/reference/workflow-kit/actions">
    Explore how Workflow actions get declared as `PublicEngineAction` and `EngineAction`.
  </Card>

</CardGroup>



### 2. Updating our database schema

To enable our users to configure the workflows, we will create the following `workflows` table.

The `workflows` tables stores the [Workflow instance object](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/workflow-instance) containing how the user ordered
the different selected [Workflow actions](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/actions). Other columns are added to store extra properties specific to
our application such as: the automation name and description, the event triggering the automation and its status (`enabled`).


|Colunm name|Column type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
id| `bigint`|
name | `text`| _The name of the automation_
description | `text`| _A short description of the automation_
workflow | `jsonb`| _A [Workflow instance object](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/workflow-instance)_
enabled | `boolean`|
trigger | `text`| _The name of the [Inngest Event](/docs/features/events-triggers) triggering the workflow_
created_at | `timestamp`|

Once the `workflows` table created, we will add two [workflow instances](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/workflow-instance) records:
- _"When a blog post is published"_: Getting a review from AI
- _"When a blog post is moved to review"_: Actions performed to optimize the distribution of blog posts

using the following SQL insert statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO "public"."workflows" ("id", "created_at", "workflow", "enabled", "trigger", "description", "name") VALUES
	(2, '2024-09-14 20:19:41.892865+00', NULL, true, 'blog-post.published', 'Actions performed to optimize the distribution of blog posts', 'When a blog post is published'),
	(1, '2024-09-14 15:46:53.822922+00', NULL, true, 'blog-post.updated', 'Getting a review from AI', 'When a blog post is moved to review');
```

<Callout>

You will find a ready-to-use database seed [in the repository](https://github.com/inngest/workflow-kit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-blog-cms/supabase/seed.sql).

</Callout>


### 3. Adding the Workflow Editor page

With our workflow actions definition and `workflows` table ready, we will create a new Next.js Page featuring the Workflow Editor.

First, we will add a new [Next.js Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) to load the worklow and render the Editor:

```tsx {{ title: "app/automation/[id]/page.tsx" }}
import { AutomationEditor } from "@/components/automation-editor";
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

export const runtime = "edge";

export default async function Automation({
  params,
}: {
  params: { id: string };
}) {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const { data: workflow } = await supabase
    .from("workflows")
    .select("*")
    .eq("id", params.id!)
    .single();
  if (workflow) {
    return <AutomationEditor workflow={workflow} />;
  } else {
    notFound();
  }
}

```

The `<AutomationEditor>` component is then rendered with the following required properties:
- `workflow={}`:  [workflow instance](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/workflow-instance) loaded from the database along side
- `event={}`: the name of the event triggering the workflow
- `availableActions={}`: [actions](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/actions#passing-actions-to-the-react-components-public-engine-action) that the user can select to build its automation


```tsx {{ title: "src/components/automation-editor.ts" }}
import { useState } from "react";
import { Editor, Provider, Sidebar } from "@inngest/workflow-kit/ui";

import { actions } from "@/inngest/workflowActions";
import { type Workflow } from "@/lib/supabase/types";

import "@inngest/workflow-kit/ui/ui.css";
import "@xyflow/react/dist/style.css";

export const AutomationEditor = ({ workflow }: { workflow: Workflow }) => {
  const [workflowDraft, updateWorkflowDraft] =
    useState<typeof workflow>(workflow);

  return (
    <Provider
      key={workflowDraft?.id}
      workflow={workflowDraft?.workflow}
      trigger={{
        event: {
          name: workflowDraft.trigger,
        },
      }}
      availableActions={actions}
      onChange={(updated) => {
        updateWorkflowDraft({
          ...workflowDraft,
          workflow: updated,
        });
      }}
    >
      <Editor>
        <Sidebar position="right"/>
      </Editor>
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

[`<Provider>`](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/components-api) is a [Controlled Component](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components), relying on the `workflow={}` object to update its UI.

Every change performed by the user will trigger the `onChange={}` callback to be called. This callback should update the object passed to the
`workflow={}` prop and can be used to also implement an auto save mechanism.

<Callout>

The complete version of the `<AutomationEditor>` is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/workflow-kit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-blog-cms/components/automation-editor.tsx).

</Callout>

Navigating to `/automation/1` renders tht following Workflow Editor UI using our workflow actions:

### 4. Implementing the Workflow Actions handlers

Let's now implement the logic our automation tasks by creating a new file in `lib/inngest` and starting with the "Add a Table of Contents" workflow action:

```tsx {{ title: "lib/inngest/workflowActionHandlers.ts" }}
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { type EngineAction, type WorkflowAction } from "@inngest/workflow-kit";

import { type BlogPost } from "../supabase/types";

import { loadBlogPost } from "../loaders/blog-post";
import { createClient } from "../supabase/server";
import { actions } from "./workflowActions";


export const actions: EngineAction[] = [
  {
    // Add a Table of Contents
    ...actionsDefinition[0],
    handler: async ({ event, step, workflowAction }) => {
      const supabase = createClient();

      const blogPost = await step.run("load-blog-post", async () =>
        loadBlogPost(event.data.id)
      );

      const aiRevision = await step.run("add-toc-to-article", async () => {
        const openai = new OpenAI({
          apiKey: process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"], // This is the default and can be omitted
        });

        const prompt = `
        Please update the below markdown article by adding a Table of Content under the h1 title. Return only the complete updated article in markdown without the wrapping "\`\`\`".

        Here is the text wrapped with "\`\`\`":
        \`\`\`
        ${getAIworkingCopy(workflowAction, blogPost)}
        \`\`\`
        `;

        const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
          model: process.env["OPENAI_MODEL"] || "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          messages: [
            {
              role: "system",
              content: "You are an AI that make text editing changes.",
            },
            {
              role: "user",
              content: prompt,
            },
          ],
        });

        return response.choices[0]?.message?.content || "";
      });

      await step.run("save-ai-revision", async () => {
        await supabase
          .from("blog_posts")
          .update({
            markdown_ai_revision: aiRevision,
            status: "under review",
          })
          .eq("id", event.data.id)
          .select("*");
      });
    },
    }
  },
];
```

This new file adds the `handler` property to the existing _"Add a Table of Contents"_ action.

A [workflow action `handler()`](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/actions#handler-function-argument-properties) has a similar signature to Inngest's function handlers, receiving two key arguments: `event` and [`step`](/docs/reference/functions/create#step).

Our _"Add a Table of Contents"_ leverages Inngest's [step API](/docs/reference/functions/step-run) to create reliable and retriable steps generating and inserting a Table of Contents.


<Callout>

The complete implementation of all workflow actions are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/workflow-kit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-blog-cms/lib/inngest/workflowActionHandlers.ts).

</Callout>



### 5. Creating an Inngest Function

With all the workflow action handlers of our automation tasks [implemented](https://github.com/inngest/workflow-kit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-blog-cms/lib/inngest/workflowActionHandlers.ts),
we can create a [`Engine`](/docs/reference/workflow-kit/engine) instance and pass it to a dedicated [Inngest Function](/docs/features/inngest-functions) that will run the automation when the `"blog-post.updated"` and `"blog-post.published"` events will be triggered:

```tsx {{ title: "lib/inngest/workflow.ts" }}
import { Engine } from "@inngest/workflow-kit";

import { loadWorkflow } from "../loaders/workflow";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { actionsWithHandlers } from "./workflowActionHandlers";

const workflowEngine = new Engine({
  actions: actionsWithHandlers,
  loader: loadWorkflow,
});

export default inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "blog-post-workflow" },
  // Triggers
  // - When a blog post is set to "review"
  // - When a blog post is published
  [{ event: "blog-post.updated" }, { event: "blog-post.published" }],
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // When `run` is called, the loader function is called with access to the event
    await workflowEngine.run({ event, step });
  }
);

```
