# Development with Docker

Inngest provides a Docker image that you can use to run the Inngest Dev Server within a container. This is useful when running Inngest locally or in a CI/CD environment.

This guide will explain how to run Inngest using Docker or [Docker Compose](#docker-compose).

## Docker image

The [`inngest/inngest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/inngest/inngest) image is available on Docker Hub. Regular updates are made to this image, so we recommend pulling the latest version. You can find the latest version release on [our Github repo](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/releases).

```bash
docker pull inngest/inngest
```

## Standalone Docker container

Docker can be useful for running the Inngest Dev Server in a standalone container. This is useful if you do not want to use the `npx inngest-cli@latest` method to run the Dev Server.

To run the Inngest container, you'll need to:

1. Expose the Dev Server port (default is `8288`).
2. Use the `inngest dev` command with the `-u` flag to specify the URL where Inngest can find your app.

In this example command, our app is running on the host machine on port `3000`. We use the `host.docker.internal` hostname to connect to the host machine from within the Docker container. For ease of reading, the command is broken up into multiple lines.

```bash
docker run -p 8288:8288 \
  inngest/inngest \
  inngest dev -u http://host.docker.internal:3000/api/inngest
```

You will then be able to access the Inngest Dev Server on your host machine at `http://localhost:8288` or whatever hostname you have configured. You may need to adjust the hostname for your app if you are using a different Docker network setup.

<Callout>
  If you decide to run the Dev Server on another port, you will need to set the `INNGEST_BASE_URL` environment variable in your app to point to the correct port. This value defaults to `http://localhost:8288`.

## Docker Compose

If you're using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run your services locally, you can easily add Inngest to your local environment. Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file that includes Inngest:

```yaml {{ filename: "docker-compose.yaml" }}
services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    environment:
      - INNGEST_DEV=1
      - INNGEST_BASE_URL=http://inngest:8288
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
  inngest:
    image: inngest/inngest:v0.27.0
    command: 'inngest dev -u http://app:3000/api/inngest'
    ports:
      - '8288:8288'
```

In this example, we have two services: `app` and `inngest`. The `app` service is your application, and the `inngest` service is the Inngest Dev Server. There are a few key configurations to note:

* The `INNGEST_DEV=1` environment variable tells the Inngest SDK it should connect to the Dev Server*.
* The `INNGEST_BASE_URL=http://inngest:8288` environment variable tells the Inngest SDK where the Dev Server is running. In our example, the `inngest` service is running on port `8288` (the default Dev Server port).
* The `command: 'inngest dev -u http://app:3000/api/inngest'` command tells the Dev Server where to find your app within the Docker network. In this example, the `app` service is running on port `3000`.
* The `ports` configuration exposes the Dev Server on port `8288` so you can view this on your host machine in the browser.

\* - The `INNGEST_DEV` environment variable was added to the TypeScript SDK in version 3.14. Prior to this version, you can set `NODE_ENV=development` to force the SDK to connect to the Dev Server.
