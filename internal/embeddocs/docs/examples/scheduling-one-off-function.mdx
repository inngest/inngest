# Scheduling a one-off function

Inngest provides a way to delay a function run to a specific time in the future. This is useful when:

* You want to schedule work in the future based on user input.
* You want to slightly delay execution of a non-urgent function for a few seconds or minutes.

This page provides a quick example of how to delay a function run to a specific time in the future using the [event payload's](/docs/events#event-payload-format) `ts` field.

## Quick Snippet

Here is a basic function that sends a reminder to a user at a given email.

```typescript
const sendReminder = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-reminder" },
  { event: "notifications/reminder.scheduled" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { user, message } = event.data;

    const { id } = await emailApi.send({
      to: user.email,
      subject: "Reminder for your upcoming event",
      body: message,
    });

    return { id }
  }
);
```

### Triggering the function with a timestamp

To trigger this function, you will send an event `"notifications/reminder.scheduled"` using `inngest.send()` with the necessary data. The `ts` field in the [event payload](/docs/events#event-payload-format) should be set to the Unix timestamp of the time you want the function to run. For example, to schedule a reminder for 5 minutes in the future:

```typescript
await inngest.send({
  name: "notifications/reminder.scheduled",
  data: {
    user: { email: "johnny.utah@fbi.gov" }
    message: "Don't forget to catch the wave at 3pm",
  },
  // Include the timestamp for 5 minutes in the future:
  ts: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000,
});
```

<Callout variant="warning">
  ⚠️ Providing a timestamp in the event only applies for starting function runs. Functions waiting for a matching event will immediately resume, regardless of the timestamp.
</Callout>

### Alternatives

Depending on your use case, you may want to consider using [scheduled functions (cron jobs)](/docs/guides/scheduled-functions) for scheduling periodic work or use [`step.sleepUntil()`](/docs/reference/functions/step-sleep-until) to add mid-function delays for a layer time.
