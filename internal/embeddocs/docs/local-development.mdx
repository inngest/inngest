# Local development

Inngest's tooling makes it easy to develop your functions locally with any framework using the Inngest Dev Server.

The [Inngest Dev Server](/docs/dev-server) is a fully-featured and [open-source](https://github.com/inngest/inngest) local version of the [Inngest Platform](/docs/platform/deployment) enabling a seamless transition from your local development to feature, staging and production environments.

## Development Flow with Inngest

The Inngest Dev Server provides all the features available in the Inngest Platform, guaranteeing a smooth transition from local dev to production environments.

Developing with Inngest looks as it follows:

1. [Configure the Inngest SDK in your application](/docs/sdk/overview)
2. [Connecting the Inngest Dev Server to your local application](/docs/learn/inngest-functions)
3. Develop your Inngest Functions with [Steps](/docs/learn/inngest-steps), [Flow Control](/docs/guides/flow-control) and [more](/docs/features/inngest-functions)
5. _(Optional) - Configure Preview environments with [our Vercel Integration](/docs/deploy/vercel)_

  light={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-local-dev-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={'The Inngest Dev Server runs locally on your machine and communicates with your local application.'}
/>

**Moving to production environments (preview envs, staging or production)**

Deploying your application to preview, staging and production environments does not require any code change:

6. [Create an Inngest App](/docs/apps) on the Inngest Platform and [configure its Event and Signing Keys on your Cloud](/docs/platform/deployment).
7. Leverage the Inngest Platform to manage and monitor Events and Function Runs

<ImageTheme
  dark={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-staging-prod-dark.jpg'}
  light={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-staging-prod-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={'When deployed, your application communicates with the Inngest Platform.'}
/>

## FAQs

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Can I run the Inngest Dev Server in production?" icon={<RiQuestionLine />}>
    The Inngest Dev Server is not designed to be run in production, but you can run it anywhere that you want including testing environments or CI/CD pipelines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="How do I test webhooks locally?" icon={<RiQuestionLine />}>
    Webhooks configured on the Platform [can be sent to the Dev Server](/docs/platform/webhooks#local-development).
  </Card>
  <Card title="How do I work with Stripe or Clerk webhooks locally?" icon={<RiQuestionLine />}>
    External webhooks from Stripe and Clerk must go through a tunnel solution (such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/)) to reach the Dev Server.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Are Crons supported locally?" icon={<RiQuestionLine />}>
    Yes. You can also trigger a function at any time by [using the "Invoke" button from the Dev Server Functions list view](/docs/dev-server).
  </Card>
  {/* <Card title="The Dev Server does not locate my local application" icon={<RiQuestionLine />}>
