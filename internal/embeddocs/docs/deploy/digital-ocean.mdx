# DigitalOcean

Inngest functions can be deployed to DigitalOcean's Functions, App Platform, or Droplets.
This page covers how to configure the [Inngest Add-Ons](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/inngest) for your DigitalOcean App Platform projects or Droplets. To configure Inngest with DigitalOcean Functions, see the [`serve()` reference](/docs/learn/serving-inngest-functions#framework-digital-ocean-functions).

## Configure a DigitalOcean App Platform project or Droplet with a new Inngest account

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A DigitalOcean account with an application deployed on App Platform or on a Droplet.
- Access to SaaS Add-Ons and environment variables in your App Platform project or Droplet.

### Step 1: Add Inngest as a SaaS Add-On

From your DigitalOcean dashboard:

- Navigate to [the Inngest Add-Ons page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/inngest)
- Click the "Add Inngest" button in the top-right.
- Select the region closest to your app's deployment.
- Click "Create Resource".

DigitalOcean will create an Inngest account for you.

You can now proceed to step 2 to access your Inngest application credentials.

### Step 2: Access your Inngest application credentials

Navigate to your [DigitalOcean Dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) and click "Add-Ons" in the left sidebar.

Once the Inngest Add-On is installed, click the "View Inngest" link to access the Inngest Dashboard:

From the Inngest Dashboard, click the keys icon in the top-left to access the Event and Signing keys:

Visit both the Event key and Signing key pages to copy their values.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Back in your DigitalOcean Dashboard, copy the Event and Signing keys into your application's environment variables as follows:

- `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` → copy from the Inngest Dashboard
- `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` → copy from the Inngest Dashboard

### You're all set: install and configure the Inngest SDK

Your DigitalOcean application is now configured with the Inngest Add-On. You can now install the Inngest SDK in your application and follow the tutorials below based on your language and framework:

- [TypeScript quick start](</docs/getting-started/nodejs-quick-start>)
- [Python quick start](</docs/getting-started/python-quick-start>)
- [Go reference](<https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/inngest/inngestgo>)

**Note:** Once your application is configured and deployed with the Inngest SDK, go to the Inngest Dashboard to [sync your application](/docs/apps/cloud).

## Configure a DigitalOcean App Platform project or Droplet with an existing Inngest account
