# Release Phases for Inngest

This pages outlines how Inngest features and products are released through 3 distinct phases of development maturity and availability to users.

The release flow varies depending on the security or scalability requirements of the newly available feature or product:

Releases can follow a non-linear flow to GA, the above graphic is not strict, but an idea of how features may flow from internal development to GA.
Additionally (_not pictured_), small features might go from internal development directly to GA for a launch.

You will find below the details of each release phase.


## Release Phases


### Developer Preview

Products or features released as a Developer Preview are still under development, made available to early users for feedback.
This implies that the new APIs or methods made available via our APIs or SDKs are flagged as experimental and might change without strict version control or notice.

Developer preview features or products cheat sheet:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| APIs | **Exposes non-final APIs that might change without strict version control or notice** |
| Documentation | Provides limited documentation that will evolve with users' feedback |
| Production Use | **Not recommended for production use and not covered by the Service Level Agreement applicable to the Enterprise plan** |
| Limitations | May come with limitations specific to the feature, such as plan-based or usage-based restrictions |
| Pricing | Limited free availability during preview phase |

Features or products currently in developer preview:

- [Realtime](/docs/features/realtime)
- [Connect](/docs/setup/connect)
- [AgentKit](https://agentkit.inngest.com/)



### Private/Public Beta

Product or features in private or public beta are nearing GA, but still require some work to meet our desired quality standards (ex, reliability improvements, scalability stress tests).  In this phase, most products or features will be almost complete and should handle workloads correctly, but may exhibit issues we were unaware of during early access.

Beta features or products cheat sheet:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| APIs | Provide almost final APIs that may change following strict version control and communications |
| Documentation | Provide extended documentation covering a getting-started guide, references, and an edge cases FAQ |
| Production Use | **Not recommended for production use and are not covered by the Service Level Agreement applicable to the Enterprise plan** |
| Support | Grants access to a channel to share feedback (_in case of private beta_) |
| Limitations | May come with limitations specific to the feature, such as plan-based or usage-based restrictions |
| Pricing | Limited free availability during preview phase |

<Callout variant="info">
**Private beta vs. public beta**

Features or products that require scalability stress tests, security considerations, or early customer feedback are good candidates for a private beta, ensuring a positive experience for all participants.
Other features might be a good fit for public beta (ex, SDKs features, Inngest Dev Server improvements)

### General Availability

A product or feature in general availability is considered secure, scalable, and stable, and is ready for use by users and customers across all plans.

General availability features or products cheat sheet:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| APIs | **Exposes final APIs that may evolve following strict version control and an associated changelog** |
| Documentation | Provide complete documentation from quickstarts, examples, and demos |
| Production Use | **Ready to be used in production by users and customers across all plans and are covered by the Service Level Agreement applicable to the Enterprise plan** |
| Limitations | Limitations are properly documented (_if any_) |
| Pricing | Pricing is moved into an entitlement |

### Deprecated

The deprecation of features or products follows the following agenda over multiple months:

1. Addition of deprecated mentions in the relevant documentation pages
    1. Publishing of migration guides (if applicable)
2. Communication with users and customers over emails, Discord, and private support Slack channels
3. Update of SDKs to highlight the deprecated APIs (if applicable)
4. Targeted email reminders weeks before the target sunset date
