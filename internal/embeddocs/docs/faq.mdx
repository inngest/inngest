## How do I run crons only in production?

There are multiple ways to achieve it:
1. Conditionally rendering depending on the environment.
```javascript
process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? { cron: "* * *" } : { event: "dev/manualXYZ" }
```
üí° If you render an event instead of a cron in the other environments, you can still trigger your functions manually if needed.

2. [Disable branch environments](/docs/platform/environments#disabling-branch-environments-in-vercel).

## How do I stop functions from running?
The best way to ensure a deprecated function doesn't run is to deploy without including it in your [serve handler](/docs/reference/serve). You can temporarily achieved the same result by archiving the function on our dashboard, but note that a new deployment will unarchive the function.

## What is the "Finalization" step in my trace?

The "finalization" step in a run's trace represents the execution of the code between your function's last step and the end of the function handler.

```ts {{ x: "10"}}
const myFunction = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "handle-import" }
  { event: "integration.connected" }
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const res = await step.run("import-data", async () => {
      // ...
    });
    // -- Finalization starts ‚¨áÔ∏è --
    const newRows = res.rows.filter((row) => row.created === true)
    return { message: `Imported ${newRows.length} rows` }
    // -- Finalization ends ‚¨ÜÔ∏è --
  },
)
```

## Why am I getting ‚ÄúEvent key not found" errors in branch environments?
Branch environments are [automatically archived](/docs/platform/environments#archiving-branch-environments) 3 days after their latest deploy.
It's possible to disable the auto archive functionality for each active environment on our [dashboard](https://app.inngest.com/env).


## How do I specify multiple serve paths for a same Vercel application on the dashboard?
You can pass multiple paths by adding their path information to each Vercel project in the [Vercel Integration‚Äôs settings](https://app.inngest.com/settings/integrations/vercel).

## What's the recommended way to redact data from step outputs?
We recommend doing [E2E encryption](/docs/reference/middleware/examples#e2-e-encryption) instead, as it's more secure and plaintext data never leaves your servers.

## Why am I getting a `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` error?
This is a Vercel error that means your function timed out within Vercel's infrastructure before it was able to respond to Inngest. More information can be found in [Vercel's docs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#max-duration).

If you're unable to sufficiently extend the timeout within Vercel, our [streaming feature](/docs/streaming) can help.

## My app's serve endpoint requires authentication. What should I do?
Your app's [serve endpoint](/docs/learn/serving-inngest-functions) needs to be accessible by our
servers, so we can trigger your functions. For this reason, we recommend disabling authentication
for the serve endpoint.

Our servers communicate securely with your app's serve endpoint using your [signing key](/docs/learn/serving-inngest-functions#signing-key).

### Vercel
By default, Vercel enables [Deployment Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection)
for both preview and generated production URLs. This means that your app's serve endpoint will be
unreachable by our servers unless you [disable Deployment Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection#configuring-deployment-protection)
or, if you're on Vercel's Pro plan, [configure protection bypass](/docs/deploy/vercel#bypassing-deployment-protection).

## Why am I getting a `killed` error when running the Dev Server?
The Inngest CLI binary may become corrupted, particularly during updates while
being downloaded. Symptoms can also include the CLI giving no output or a
`Segmentation fault`.

Clear your npx cache by running `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`, or the cache of whichever
package manager you're using to run the Dev Server (for example `pnpm prune`, `yarn
cache clean`).

If the error still persists, please reach out to us on [our Discord](https://www.inngest.com/discord).

## Why am I getting a `NON_DETERMINISTIC_FUNCTION` error?
This is an error present in v2.x.x of the TypeScript SDK that can be thrown when a deployment changes a function in the middle of a run.

If you're seeing this error, we encourage you to upgrade to v3.x.x of the TypeScript SDK, which will recover and continue gracefully from this circumstance.

For more information, see the [Upgrading from v2 to v3](/docs/sdk/migration) migration guide.

## Why am I getting an `Illegal invocation` error?
When making requests to an Inngest Server, the TypeScript SDK uses
[`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). The
actual implementation of this varies across different runtimes, versions, and
environments. The SDK tries to account for these differences internally, but
sometimes providing a custom `fetch` function is necessary or wanted.

This error is usually indicative of providing a custom `fetch` function to
either a `new Inngest()` or `serve()` call, but not carrying over its
[binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind).
This is a common JavaScript gotcha, where bound methods lose their binding when
passed into an object.

To resolve, make sure that you rebind the `fetch` function as it is passed. This
is commonly bound to `globalThis`, though your specific runtime/version/environment
may vary.

```ts
new Inngest({
  fetch: fetch.bind(globalThis),
});
```

## Why is the dev server polling endpoints that don't exist?
The dev server will automatically detect and connect to apps running on common ports and endpoints. These endpoints include `/api/inngest`, `/x/inngest`, `/.netlify/functions/inngest`, `/.redwood/functions/inngest`.

You can disable auto-discovery by passing the `--no-discovery` flag to the `dev` command:

```sh
npx inngest-cli@latest dev --no-discovery
```

Learn more about this in the [dev server](/docs/dev-server#auto-discovery) docs.
