# Rate limit function execution

Set a _hard limit_ on how many function runs can start within a time period. Events that exceed the rate limit are _skipped_ and do not trigger functions to start.

See the [Rate Limiting guide](/docs/guides/rate-limiting) for more information about how this feature works.

```ts
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "synchronize-data",
    rateLimit: {
      key: "event.data.company_id",
      limit: 1,
      period: "4h",
    },
  },
  { event: "intercom/company.updated" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // This function will be rate limited
    // It will only run 1 once per 4 hours for a given event payload with matching company_id
  }
);
```

## Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="rateLimit" type="object">
    Options to configure how to rate limit function execution

    <Properties nested={true}>
      <Property name="limit" type="number" required>
        The maximum number of functions to run in the given time period.
      </Property>
      <Property name="period" type="string" required>
        The time period of which to set the limit. The period begins when the first matching event is received.
        Current permitted values are from `1s` to `24h`.
      </Property>
      <Property name="key" type="string">
        A unique key expression to apply the limit to. The expression is evaluated for each triggering event.

        Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info. Examples:

        * Rate limit per customer id: `'event.data.customer_id'`
        * Rate limit per account and email address: `'event.data.account_id + "-" + event.user.email'`
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Examples

### Limiting synchronization triggered by webhook events

In this example, we use events from the Intercom webhook. The webhook can be overly chatty and send multiple `intercom/company.updated` events in a short time window. We also only really care to sync the user's data from Intercom no more than 4 times per day, so we set our limit to `6h`:

```ts
/** Example event payload:
{
  name: "intercom/company.updated",
  data: {
    company_id: "123456789",
    company_name: "Acme, Inc."
  }
}
*/
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "synchronize-data",
    rateLimit: {
      key: "event.data.company_id",
      limit: 1,
      period: "4h",
    },
  },
  { event: "intercom/company.updated" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const company = await step.run(
      "fetch-latest-company-data-from-intercom",
      async () => {
        return await client.companies.find({
          companyId: event.data.company_id,
        });
      }
    );

    await step.run("update-company-data-in-database", async () => {
      return await database.companies.upsert({ id: company.id }, company);
    });
  }
);
```

### Send at most one email for multiple alerts over an hour

When there is an issue in your system, you may want to send your user an email notification, but don't want to spam them. The issue may repeat several times within the span of few minutes, but the user really just needs one email. You can

```ts
/** Example event payload:
{
  name: "service/check.failed",
  data: {
    incident_id: "01HB9PWHZ4CZJYRAGEY60XEHCZ",
    issue: "HTTP uptime check failed at 2023-09-26T21:23:51.515631317Z",
    user_id: "user_aW5uZ2VzdF9pc19mdWNraW5nX2F3ZXNvbWU=",
    service_name: "api",
    service_id: "01HB9Q2EFBYG2B7X8VCD6JVRFH"
  },
  user: {
    external_id: "user_aW5uZ2VzdF9pc19mdWNraW5nX2F3ZXNvbWU=",
    email: "user@example.com"
  }
}
*/
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "send-check-failed-notification",
    rateLimit: {
      // Don't send duplicate emails to the same user for the same service over 1 hour
      key: `event.data.user_id + "-" + event.data.service_id`,
      limit: 1,
      period: "1h",
    },
  },
  { event: "service/check.failed" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("send-alert-email", async () => {
      return await resend.emails.send({
        from: "notifications@myco.com",
        to: event.user.email,
        subject: `ALERT: ${event.data.issue}`,
        text: `Dear user, ...`,
      });
    });
  }
);
```
