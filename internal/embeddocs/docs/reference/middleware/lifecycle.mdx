# Middleware lifecycle <VersionBadge version="v2.0.0+" />

## Hook reference

The `init()` function can return functions for two separate lifecycles to hook into.

<Callout>
ðŸ’¡ All lifecycle and hook functions can be synchronous or `async` functions - the SDK will always wait until a middleware's function has resolved before continuing to the next one.

          ### `onFunctionRun` lifecycle

          Triggered when a function is going to be executed.

          <Properties name="Arguments" nested>
               <Property name="ctx" type="object">
                    The input data for the function. Only `event` and `runId` are available at this point.
               </Property>
               <Property name="steps" type="array">
                    An array of previously-completed step objects.

               <Property name="transformInput" type="function">
                    Called once the input for the function has been set up. This is where you can modify the input before the function starts.

                    Has the same input as the containing `onFunctionRun()` lifecycle function, but with a complete `ctx` object, including `step` tooling.

               <Property name="afterMemoization" type="function">
                    Called after the function has finished memoizing state (running over previously-seen code).

                    Called after the function has finished executing and before the response is sent back to Inngest. This is where you can modify the output.

                              An object containing the data to be sent back to Inngest in the `data` key, and an original `error` (if any) that threw.

                              An object containing a `data` key to overwrite the data that will be sent back to Inngest for this step or function.

                    Called when execution is complete and a final response is returned (success or an error), which will end the run.

                    This function is not guaranteed to be called on every execution. It may be called multiple times if there are many parallel executions or during retries.

                    <Properties name="Arguments" nested collapse>
                          <Property name="result" type="object" required>
                              An object that contains either the successful `data` ending the run or the `error` that has been thrown. Both outputs have already been affected by `transformOutput`.
