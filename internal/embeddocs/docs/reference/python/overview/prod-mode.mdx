# Production mode

When the SDK is in production mode it will try to connect to Inngest Cloud instead of the Inngest Dev Server. Production mode is opt-out for security reasons.

## How to opt-out

You'll want to disable production mode whenever you're using the Inngest Dev Server. This is typically during local development and CI. Production mode can be disabled in 2 ways:
1. Set the `INNGEST_DEV` environment variable to `1`.
2. Set the `Inngest`'s `is_production` constructor argument to `false`.

Using the `INNGEST_DEV` environment variable is the recommended way to disable production mode. But make sure that it isn't set in production!

`Inngest`'s `is_production` constructor argument is useful for disabling production mode based on whatever logic you want. For example, you could control it using the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable:
```py
import inngest

inngest.Inngest(
    app_id="my_flask_app",
    is_production=os.environ.get("FLASK_ENV") == "production",
)
```
