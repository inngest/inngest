# Modal

This guide will help you use setup an Inngest app in [Modal](https://modal.com), a platform for building and deploying serverless Python applications.

## Setting up your development environment

This section will help you setup your development environment. You'll have an Inngest Dev Server running locally and a FastAPI app running in Modal.

### Creating a tunnel

Since we need bidirectional communication between the Dev Server and your app, you'll also need a tunnel to allow your app to reach your locally-running Dev Server. We recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for this.

```sh
# Tunnel to the Dev Server's port
ngrok http 8288
```

This should output a public URL that can reach port `8288` on your machine. The URL can be found in the `Forwarding` part of ngrok's output:
```
Forwarding    https://23ef-173-10-53-121.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8288
```

### Creating and deploying a FastAPI app

Create an `.env` file that contains the tunnel URL:
```
INNGEST_DEV=https://23ef-173-10-53-121.ngrok-free.app
```

Create a dependency file that Modal will use to install dependencies. For this guide, we'll use `requirements.txt`:
```
fastapi==0.115.0
inngest==0.4.12
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```

Create a `main.py` file that contains your FastAPI app:
```py
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI
import inngest
import inngest.fast_api
import modal

load_dotenv()

app = modal.App("test-fast-api")

# Load all environment variables that start with "INNGEST_"
env: dict[str, str] = {}
for k, v, in os.environ.items():
    if k.startswith("INNGEST_"):
        env[k] = v

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim()
    .pip_install_from_requirements("requirements.txt")
    .env(env)
)

fast_api_app = FastAPI()

# Create an Inngest client
inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(app_id="fast_api_example")

# Create an Inngest function
@inngest_client.create_function(
    fn_id="my-fn",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="my-event"),
)
async def fn(ctx: inngest.Context) -> str:
    print(ctx.event)
    return "done"

# Serve the Inngest endpoint (its path is /api/inngest)
inngest.fast_api.serve(fast_api_app, inngest_client, [fn])

@app.function(image=image)
@modal.asgi_app()
def fastapi_app():
    return fast_api_app
```

Deploy your app to Modal:
```sh
modal deploy main.py
```

Your terminal should show the deployed app's URL:

```
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ”¨ Created web function fastapi_app =>
    https://test-fast-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
```

To test whether the deploy worked, send a request to the Inngest endpoint (note that we added the `/api/inngest` to the Modal URL). It should output JSON similar to the following:
```sh
$ curl https://test-fast-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/api/inngest
{"schema_version": "2024-05-24", "authentication_succeeded": null, "function_count": 1, "has_event_key": false, "has_signing_key": false, "has_signing_key_fallback": false, "mode": "dev"}
```

### Syncing with the Dev Server

Start the Dev Server, specifying the FastAPI app's Inngest endpoint:
```sh
npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u https://test-fast-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/api/inngest --no-discovery
```

In your browser, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8288/apps`. Your app should be successfully synced.

## Deploying to production

A production Inngest app is very similar to an development app. The only difference is with environment variables:
- `INNGEST_DEV` must not be set. Alternatively, you can set it to `0`.
- `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` must be set. Its value can be found on the [event keys page](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/manage/keys).
- `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` must be set. Its value can be found on the [signing key page](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/manage/signing-key).

Once your app is deployed with these environment variables, you can sync it on our [new app page](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/apps/sync-new).

For more information about syncing, please see our [docs](/docs/apps/cloud).
