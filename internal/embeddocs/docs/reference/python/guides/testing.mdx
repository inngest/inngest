# Testing

## Unit testing

If you'd like to unit test without an Inngest server, the `mocked` (requires `v0.4.14+`)  library can simulate much of the Inngest server's behavior.

<Callout variant="warning">
The `mocked` library is experimental. It may have interface and behavioral changes that don't follow semantic versioning.
</Callout>

Let's say you've defined this function somewhere in your app:

```python
import inngest

def create_message(name: object) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

client = inngest.Inngest(app_id="my-app")

@client.create_function(
    fn_id="greet",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="user.login"),
)
async def greet(ctx: inngest.Context) -> str:
    message = await ctx.step.run(
        "create-message",
        create_message,
        ctx.event.data["name"],
    )

    return message
```

You can unit test it like this:

```python
import unittest
import inngest
from inngest.experimental import mocked
from .functions import greet

# Mocked Inngest client. The app_id can be any string (it's currently unused)
client_mock = mocked.Inngest(app_id="test")

# A normal Python test class
class TestGreet(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_greet(self) -> None:
        # Trigger the function with an in-memory, simulated Inngest server
        res = mocked.trigger(
            greet,
            inngest.Event(name="user.login", data={"name": "Alice"}),
            client_mock,
        )

        # Assert that it ran as expected
        assert res.status is mocked.Status.COMPLETED
        assert res.output == "Hello, Alice!"
```

### Limitations

The `mocked` library has some notable limitations:
- `ctx.step.invoke` and `ctx.step.wait_for_event` must be stubbed using the `step_stubs` parameter of `mocked.trigger`.
- `step.send_event` does not send events. It returns a stubbed value.
- `step.sleep` and `step.sleep_until` always sleep for 0 seconds.

### Stubbing

Stubbing is required for `ctx.step.invoke` and `ctx.step.wait_for_event`. Here's an example of how to stub these functions:

```python
# Real production function
@client.create_function(
    fn_id="signup",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="user.signup"),
)
def signup(ctx: inngest.ContextSync) -> bool:
    email_id = ctx.step.invoke(
        "send-email",
        function=send_email,
    )

    event = ctx.step.wait_for_event(
        "wait-for-reply",
        event="email.reply",
        if_exp=f"async.data.email_id == '{email_id}'",
        timeout=datetime.timedelta(days=1),
    )
    user_replied = event is not None
    return user_replied

# Mocked Inngest client
client_mock = mocked.Inngest(app_id="test")

class TestSignup(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_signup(self) -> None:
        res = mocked.trigger(
            fn,
            inngest.Event(name="test"),
            client_mock,

            # Stub the invoke and wait_for_event steps. The keys are the step
            # IDs
            step_stubs={
                "send-email": "email-id-abc123",
                "wait-for-reply": inngest.Event(
                    data={"text": "Sounds good!"}, name="email.reply"
                ),
            },
        )
        assert res.status is mocked.Status.COMPLETED
        assert res.output is True
```

To simulate a `ctx.step.wait_for_event` timeout, stub the step with `mocked.Timeout`.

## Integration testing

If you'd like to start and stop a real Dev Server with your integration tests, the `dev_server` (requires `v0.4.15+`) library can help. It requires `npm` to be installed on your machine.

<Callout variant="warning">
The `dev_server` library is experimental. It may have interface and behavioral changes that don't follow semantic versioning.
</Callout>

You can use the library in your `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
from inngest.experimental import dev_server

def pytest_configure(config: pytest.Config) -> None:
    dev_server.server.start()

def pytest_unconfigure(config: pytest.Config) -> None:
    dev_server.server.stop()
```

This Dev Server will not automatically discover your app. You'll need to manually sync by sending a `PUT` request to your app's Inngest endpoint (`/api/inngest` by default).

Since Pytest automatically discovers and runs `conftest.py` files, simply running your `pytest` command will start the Dev Server before running tests and stop the Dev Server after running tests.
