# Python SDK migration guide: v0.3 to v0.4

This guide will help you migrate your Inngest Python SDK from v0.3 to v0.4 by providing a summary of the breaking changes.

## Middleware

### Constructor

Added the `raw_request` arg to the constructor. This is the raw HTTP request received by the `serve` function. Its usecase is predominately for platforms that include critical information in the request, like environment variables in Cloudflare Workers.

### `transform_input`

Added the `steps` arg, which was previous in `ctx._steps`. This is useful in encryption middleware.

Added the `function` arg, which is the `inngest.Function` object. This is useful for middleware that needs to know the function's metadata (like error reporting).

Its return type is now `None` since modifying data should happen by mutating args.

### `transform_output`

Replaced the `output` arg with `result` arg. Its type is the new `inngest.TransformOutputResult` class:
```py
!snippet:path=snippets/py/v0_4/migration_to/transform_output.py
```

Its return type is now `None` since modifying data should happen by mutating args.

## Removed exports

- `inngest.FunctionID` -- No use case.
- `inngest.Output` -- Replaced by `inngest.TransformOutputResult`.

## Removed `async_mode` arg in `inngest.django.serve`

This argument is no longer needed since async mode is inferred based on the Inngest functions you declare. If you have one or more `async` Inngest functions then async mode is enabled.

## `NonRetriableError`

Removed the `cause` arg since it wasn't actually used. We'll eventually reintroduce it in a proper way.
