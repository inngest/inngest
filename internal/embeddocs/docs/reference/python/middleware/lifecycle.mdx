# Python middleware lifecycle

The order of middleware lifecycle hooks is as follows:
1. [`transform_input`](#transform-input)
2. [`before_memoization`](#before-memoization)
3. [`after_memoization`](#after-memoization)
4. [`before_execution`](#before-execution)
5. [`after_execution`](#after-execution)
6. [`transform_output`](#transform-output)
7. [`before_response`](#before-response)

All of these functions may be called multiple times in a single function run. For example, if your function has 2 steps then all of the hooks will run 3 times (once for each step and once for the function).

Additionally, there are two hooks when sending events:
1. [`before_send_events`](#before-send-events)
2. [`after_send_events`](#after-send-events)

## Hook reference

### `transform_input`

Called when receiving a request from Inngest and before running any functions. Commonly used to mutate data sent by Inngest, like decryption.

<Properties name="Arguments" nested>
  <Property name="ctx" type="Context" required>
    `ctx` argument passed to Inngest functions.
  </Property>
  <Property name="function" type="Function" required>
    Inngest function object.
  </Property>
  <Property name="steps" type="StepMemos" required>
    Memoized step data.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### `before_memoization`

Called before checking memoized step data.

### `after_memoization`

Called after exhausting memoized step data.

### `before_execution`

Called before executing "new code". For example, `before_execution` is called after returning the last memoized step data, since function-level code after that step is "new".

### `after_execution`

Called after executing "new code".

### `transform_output`

Called after a step or function returns. Commonly used to mutate data before sending it back to Inngest, like encryption.

<Properties name="Arguments" nested>
  <Property name="result" type="TransformOutputResult" required>
    <Properties nested collapse>
      <Property name="error" type="Exception">
        Only set if there's an error.
      </Property>
      <Property name="output" type="object">
        Step or function output. Since `None` is a valid output, always call the `has_output` method before accessing the output.
      </Property>
      <Property name="step" type="TransformOutputStepInfo">
        Step or function output. Since `None` is a valid output, always call the `has_output` method before accessing the output.

        <Properties nested collapse>
          <Property name="id" type="str" required>
            Step ID.
          </Property>
          <Property name="op" type="object">
            Step type enum. Useful in very rare cases.
          </Property>
          <Property name="opts" type="dict[str, object]">
            Step options. Useful in very rare cases.
          </Property>
        </Properties>
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Property>
</Properties>

### `before_response`

Called before sending a response back to Inngest.

### `before_send_events`

Called before sending events to Inngest.

<Properties name="Arguments" nested>
  <Property name="events" type="list[Event]" required>
    Events to send.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### `after_send_events`

Called after sending events to Inngest.

<Properties name="Arguments" nested>
  <Property name="result" type="SendEventsResult" required>
    <Properties nested collapse>
      <Property name="error" type="str">
        Error string if an error occurred.
      </Property>
      <Property name="ids" type="list[str]" required>
        Event IDs.
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Property>
</Properties>
