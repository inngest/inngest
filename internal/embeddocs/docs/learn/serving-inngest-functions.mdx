# Setting up your Inngest app

With Inngest, you define functions or workflows using the SDK and deploy them to whatever platform or cloud provider you want including including serverless and container runtimes.

For Inngest to remotely execute your functions, you will need to set up a connection between your app and Inngest. This can be done in one of two ways:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="serve()" href="#serving-inngest-functions">
    <p className="my-4">Serve your Inngest functions by creating an HTTP endpoint in your application.</p>

    <p className="my-2">**Ideal for**:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Serverless platforms like Vercel, Lambda, etc.</li>
      <li>Adding Inngest to an existing API.</li>
      <li>Zero changes to your CI/CD pipeline</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="connect()" href="/docs/setup/connect">
    <p className="my-4">Connect to Inngest's servers using out-bound WebSocket connection.</p>

    <p className="my-2">**Ideal for**:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Container runtimes (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)</li>
      <li>Latency sensitive applications</li>
      <li>Horizontal scaling with workers</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Inngest functions are portable, so you can migrate between `serve()` and `connect()` as well as cloud providers.

## Serving Inngest functions

<GuideSelector
  options={[
    { key: "typescript", title: "TypeScript" },
    { key: "go", title: "Go" },
    { key: "python", title: "Python" },
  ]}
>

<GuideSection show="typescript">

Inngest provides a `serve()` handler which adds an API endpoint to your router. You expose your functions to Inngest through this HTTP endpoint. To make automated deploys much easier, **the endpoint needs to be defined at `/api/inngest`** (though you can [change the API path](/docs/reference/serve#serve-client-functions-options)).

```ts {{ title: "./api/inngest.ts" }}
// All serve handlers have the same arguments:
serve({
  client: inngest, // a client created with new Inngest()
  functions: [fnA, fnB], // an array of Inngest functions to serve, created with inngest.createFunction()
  /* Optional extra configuration */
});
```

  Want us to add support for another framework? Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/website) or tell us about it on our [Discord](/discord).
</Callout>

### Framework: Astro <VersionBadge version="v3.8.0+" />

Add the following to `./src/pages/api/inngest.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/astro";
import { functions, inngest } from "../../inngest";

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Astro example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-astro) for more information.

### Framework: AWS Lambda <VersionBadge version="v1.5.0+" />

We recommend using [Lambda function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) to trigger your functions, as these require no other configuration or cost.

Alternatively, you can use an API Gateway to route requests to your Lambda. The handler supports [API Gateway V1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html) and [API Gateway V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-lambda.html). If you are running API Gateway behind a proxy or have some other configuration, you may have to specify the `serveHost` and `servePath` options when calling `serve()` to ensure Inngest knows the URL where you are serving your functions. See [Configuring the API path](/docs/reference/serve#serve-client-functions-options) for more details.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/lambda";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import fnA from "./fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/lambda";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import fnA from "./fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Bun.serve()

You can use the `inngest/bun` handler with `Bun.serve()` for a lightweight
Inngest server:

```ts {{ title: "index.ts" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/bun";
import { functions, inngest } from "./inngest";

Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  routes: {
    // ...other routes...
    "/api/inngest": (request: Request) => {
      return serve({ client: inngest, functions })(request);
    },
  },
});
```

See the [Bun example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/bun) for more information.


### Framework: Cloudflare Pages Functions

You can import the Inngest API server when using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare pages functions</a>  within `/functions/api/inngest.js`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/cloudflare";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const onRequest = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/cloudflare";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const onRequest = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Framework: Cloudflare Workers <VersionBadge version="v3.19.15+" />

You can export `"inngest/cloudflare"`'s `serve()` as your Cloudflare Worker:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { serve } from "inngest/cloudflare";
import { inngest } from "./client";
import fnA from "./fnA";

export default {
  fetch: serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [fnA],
    // We suggest explicitly defining the path to serve Inngest functions
    servePath: "/api/inngest",
  }),
};
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  To automatically pass environment variables defined with Wrangler to Inngest function handlers, use the [Cloudflare Workers bindings middleware](/docs/examples/middleware/cloudflare-workers-environment-variables).
</Tip>

#### Local development with Wrangler

When developing locally with Wrangler and the `--remote` flag, your code is
deployed and run remotely. To use this with a local Inngest Dev Server, you must
use a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or
[localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) to allow access to
the Dev Server from the internet.

```sh
ngrok http 8288
```

```toml {{ title: "wrangler.toml" }}
[vars]
# The URL of your tunnel. This enables the "cloud" worker to access the local Dev Server
INNGEST_DEV = "https://YOUR_TUNNEL_URL.ngrok.app"
# This may be needed:
# The URL of your local server. This enables the Dev Server to access the app at this local URL
# You may have to change this URL to match your local server if running on a different port.
# Without this, the "cloud" worker may attempt to redirect Inngest to the wrong URL.
INNGEST_SERVE_HOST = "http://localhost:8787"
```

See an example of this in the [Hono framework example on GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-hono).

### Framework: DigitalOcean Functions

The DigitalOcean serve function allows you to deploy Inngest to DigitalOcean serverless functions.
Because DigitalOcean does not provide the request URL in its function arguments, you **must** include
the function URL and path when configuring your handler:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/digitalocean";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

const main = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
  // Your digitalocean hostname.  This is required otherwise your functions won't work.
  serveHost: "https://faas-sfo3-your-url.doserverless.co",
  // And your DO path, also required.
  servePath: "/api/v1/web/fn-your-uuid/inngest",
});

// IMPORTANT: Makes the function available as a module in the project.
// This is required for any functions that require external dependencies.
module.exports.main = main;
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/digitalocean";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

const main = serve(inngest, [fnA], {
  // Your digitalocean hostname.  This is required otherwise your functions won't work.
  serveHost: "https://faas-sfo3-your-url.doserverless.co",
  // And your DO path, also required.
  servePath: "/api/v1/web/fn-your-uuid/inngest",
});

// IMPORTANT: Makes the function available as a module in the project.
// This is required for any functions that require external dependencies.
module.exports.main = main;
```
</CodeGroup>

Inngest functions can also be deployed to [DigitalOcean's App Platform or Droplets](/docs/deploy/digital-ocean).


### Framework: ElysiaJS

For [deployment options](https://elysiajs.com/patterns/deploy.html), Elysia can compile to a binary or to JavaScript, or you can deploy with Docker or Railway.


```ts {{ title: "src/index.ts" }}
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { serve } from "inngest/bun";
import { functions, inngest } from "./inngest";

const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions,
});

const inngestHandler = new Elysia().all("/api/inngest", ({ request }) =>
  handler(request)
);

// register the handler with Elysia
const app = new Elysia()
.use(inngestHandler)

```

Elysia's `use` function expects a single argument. We make use of the `all` method for the inngest api route to handle the expected
methods and then get the request off of the context object passed to elysia handlers.

See the [ElysiaJS
example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-elysiajs)
for more information.

### Framework: Express

You can serve Inngest functions within your existing Express app, deployed to any hosting provider
like Render, Fly, AWS, K8S, and others:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

// Important:  ensure you add JSON middleware to process incoming JSON POST payloads.
app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  // Expose the middleware on our recommended path at `/api/inngest`.
  "/api/inngest",
  serve({ client: inngest, functions: [fnA] })
);
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

// Important:  ensure you add JSON middleware to process incoming JSON POST payloads.
app.use(express.json());
app.use(
  // Expose the middleware on our recommended path at `/api/inngest`.
  "/api/inngest",
  serve(inngest, [fnA])
);
```
</CodeGroup>

You must ensure you're using the `express.json()` middleware otherwise your functions won't be
executed. **Note** - You may need to set [`express.json()`'s `limit` option](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express.json) to something higher than the default `100kb` to support larger event payloads and function state.

See the [Express
example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-express)
for more information.

#### Streaming <VersionBadge version="v3.39.2+" />

Express can also stream responses back to Inngest, potentially allowing much
longer timeouts.

To enable this, set add the `streaming: "force"` option to your serve handler:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [...fns],
  streaming: "force",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, check out the [Streaming](/docs/streaming) page.


### Framework: Fastify <VersionBadge version="v2.6.0+" />

You can serve Inngest functions within your existing Fastify app.

We recommend using the exported `inngestFastify` plugin, though we also expose a generic `serve()` function if you'd like to manually create a route.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "Plugin" }}
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { fastifyPlugin } from "inngest/fastify";
import { inngest, fnA } from "./inngest";

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.register(fastifyPlugin, {
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
  options: {},
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Custom route (v3)" }}
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { serve } from "inngest/fastify";
import { fnA, inngest } from "./inngest";

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.route({
  method: ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
  handler: serve({ client: inngest, functions: [fnA] }),
  url: "/api/inngest",
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```
```ts {{ title: "Custom route (v2)" }}
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { serve } from "inngest/fastify";
import { inngest, fnA } from "./inngest";

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.route({
  method: ["GET", "POST", "PUT"],
  handler: serve(inngest, [fnA]),
  url: "/api/inngest",
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Fastify example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-fastify) for more information.

### Framework: Fresh (Deno)

Inngest works with Deno's <a href="https://fresh.deno.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fresh
framework</a> via the `esm.sh` CDN.  Add the serve handler to `./api/inngest.ts` as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "https://esm.sh/inngest/deno/fresh";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client.ts";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "https://esm.sh/inngest/deno/fresh";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client.ts";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(inngest, [fnA]);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Framework: Google Cloud Run Functions

Google's [Functions Framework](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-nodejs) has an Express-compatible API which enables you to use the Express serve handler to deploy your Inngest functions to Google Cloud Run. This is an example of a function:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import * as ff from "@google-cloud/functions-framework";
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

ff.http(
  "inngest",
  serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [fnA],
    servePath: "/",
  })
);
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import * as ff from "@google-cloud/functions-framework";
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest } from "./src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "./src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

ff.http(
  'inngest',
  serve(
    inngest,
    [fnA],
    { servePath: "/" },
  )
);
```
</CodeGroup>

You can run this locally with `npx @google-cloud/functions-framework --target=inngest` which will serve your Inngest functions on port `8080`.

See the [Google Cloud Functions example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-google-functions-framework) for more information.

<Callout>
1st generation Cloud Run Functions are not officially supported. Using one may result in a signature verification error.
</Callout>

### Framework: Firebase Cloud Functions

Based on the Google Cloud Function architecture, the Firebase Cloud Functions provide a different API to serve functions using `onRequest`:

```typescript
import { onRequest } from "firebase-functions/v2/https";

import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import { inngest as inngestClient } from "./inngest/client";

export const inngest = onRequest(
  serve({
    client: inngestClient,
    functions: [/* ...functions... */],
  })
);
```

<Callout>

Firebase Cloud Functions require configuring `INNGEST_SERVE_PATH` with the custom function path.

For example, for a project named `inngest-firebase-functions` deployed on the `us-central1` region, the `INNGEST_SERVE_PATH` value will be as follows:

```
/inngest-firebase-functions/us-central1/inngest/
```

</Callout>

To serve your Firebase Cloud Function locally, use the following command:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

Please note that you'll need to start your Inngest Local Dev Server with the `-u` flag to match our Firebase Cloud Function's custom path  as follows:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://127.0.0.1:5001/inngest-firebase-functions/us-central1/inngest
```

_The above command example features a project named `inngest-firebase-functions` deployed on the `us-central1` region_.

### Framework: H3 <VersionBadge version="v2.7.0+" />

Inngest supports [H3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) and frameworks built upon it. Here's a simple H3 server that hosts serves an Inngest function.

<CodeGroup filename="index.js">
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { createApp, eventHandler, toNodeListener } from "h3";
import { serve } from "inngest/h3";
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { inngest } from "./inngest/client";
import fnA from "./inngest/fnA";

const app = createApp();
app.use(
  "/api/inngest",
  eventHandler(
    serve({
      client: inngest,
      functions: [fnA],
    })
  )
);

createServer(toNodeListener(app)).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { createApp, eventHandler, toNodeListener } from "h3";
import { serve } from "inngest/h3";
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { inngest } from "./inngest/client";
import fnA from "./inngest/fnA";

const app = createApp();
app.use("/api/inngest", eventHandler(serve(inngest, [fnA])));

createServer(toNodeListener(app)).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [github.com/unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) repository for more information about how to host an H3 endpoint.

### Framework: Hono

Inngest supports the [Hono](https://hono.dev/) framework which is popularly deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Add the following to `./src/index.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "inngest/hono";
import { functions, inngest } from "./inngest";

const app = new Hono();

app.on(
  ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
  "/api/inngest",
  serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions,
  })
);

export default app;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  To automatically pass environment variables defined with Wrangler to Inngest function handlers, use the [Hono bindings middleware](/docs/examples/middleware/cloudflare-workers-environment-variables).
</Tip>

<Info>
  If you're using Hono with Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI in "_cloud_" mode, follow [the documentation above](#local-development-with-wrangler) for Cloudflare Workers.
</Info>

See the [Hono example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/blob/main/examples/framework-hono) for more information.

### Framework: Koa <VersionBadge version="v3.6.0+" />

Add the following to your routing file:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/koa";
import Koa from "koa";
import bodyParser from "koa-bodyparser";
import { functions, inngest } from "./inngest";

const app = new Koa();
app.use(bodyParser()); // make sure we're parsing incoming JSON

const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions,
});

app.use((ctx) => {
  if (ctx.request.path === "/api/inngest") {
    return handler(ctx);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Koa example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-koa) for more information.

### Framework: NestJS

Add the following to `./src/main.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { NestExpressApplication } from '@nestjs/platform-express';
import { serve } from 'inngest/express';

import { inngest } from '@modules/common/inngest/client';
import { getInngestFunctions } from '@modules/common/inngest/functions';

import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule, {
    bodyParser: true,
  });

  // Setup inngest
  app.useBodyParser('json', { limit: '10mb' });

  // Inject Dependencies into inngest functions

  const logger = app.get(Logger);
  const appService = app.get(AppService);

  // Pass dependencies into this function
  const inngestFunctions = getInngestFunctions({
    appService,
    logger,
  });

  // Register inngest endpoint
  app.use(
    '/api/inngest',
    serve({
      client: inngest,
      functions: inngestFunctions,
    }),
  );

  // Start listening for http requests
  await app.listen(3000);
}

bootstrap();
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [NestJS example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-nestjs) for more information.


### Framework: Next.js

Inngest has first class support for Next.js API routes, allowing you to easily create the Inngest API. Both the App Router and the Pages Router are supported. For the App Router, Inngest requires `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` methods.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript {{ title: "App Router" }}
// src/app/api/inngest/route.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own functions

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
```typescript {{ title: "Pages Router" }}
// pages/api/inngest.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "../../inngest/client";
import fnA from "../../inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export default serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Streaming <VersionBadge version="v1.8.0+" />

Next.js Functions hosted on [Vercel](/docs/deploy/vercel) with Fluid compute can stream responses back to Inngest which can help you reach the maximum duration of 800s (13m20s) provided you are on a paid Vercel plan.

To enable this, add the `streaming: "force"` option to your serve handler:

**Next.js 13+ on Fluid compute**
<CodeGroup>
```ts
export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [...fns],
  streaming: "force",
});
```
</CodeGroup>


<details>
  <summary>**Edge runtime**</summary>
  <div>
  If you are not using Vercel Fluid compute, you can also stream responses to Inngest by running on their [edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/edge).

  To enable this, set your runtime to `"edge"` and add the `streaming: "allow"` option to your serve handler:

  **Next.js 13+**

    client: inngest,
    functions: [fnA],
  })
);
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Nitro example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-nitro) for more information.

### Framework: Nuxt <VersionBadge version="v0.9.2+" />

Inngest has first class support for [Nuxt server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes), allowing you to easily create the Inngest API.

Add the following within `./server/api/inngest.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/nuxt";
import { inngest } from "~~/inngest/client";
import fnA from "~~/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export default defineEventHandler(
  serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [fnA],
  })
);
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/nuxt";
import { inngest } from "~~/inngest/client";
import fnA from "~~/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export default defineEventHandler(
  serve(inngest, [fnA])
);
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Nuxt example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-nuxt) for more information.


### Framework: Redwood

Add the following to `api/src/functions/inngest.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/redwood";
import { inngest } from "src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [fnA],
  servePath: "/api/inngest",
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
import { serve } from "inngest/redwood";
import { inngest } from "src/inngest/client";
import fnA from "src/inngest/fnA"; // Your own function

export const handler = serve(
  inngest,
  [fnA],
  { servePath: "/api/inngest" }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

You should also update your `redwood.toml` to add `apiUrl = "/api"`, ensuring your API is served
at the `/api` root.

#### Streaming <VersionBadge version="v2.3.0+" />

Remix Edge Functions hosted on [Vercel](/docs/deploy/vercel) can also stream responses back to Inngest, giving you a much higher request timeout of 15 minutes (up from 10 seconds on the Vercel Hobby plan!).

To enable this, set your runtime to `"edge"` (see [Quickstart for Using Edge Functions | Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/quickstart)) and add the `streaming: "allow"` option to your serve handler:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

const handler = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [...fns],
  streaming: "allow",
});
```
```ts {{ title: "v2" }}
export const config = {
  runtime: "edge",
};

const handler = serve(inngest, [...fns], {
  streaming: "allow",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, check out the [Streaming](/docs/streaming) page.

### Framework: SvelteKit <VersionBadge version="v3.5.0+" />

Add the following to `./src/routes/api/inngest/+server.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "v3" }}
import { functions, inngest } from '$lib/inngest';
import { serve } from 'inngest/sveltekit';

const inngestServe = serve({ client: inngest, functions });
export const GET = inngestServe.GET;
export const POST = inngestServe.POST;
export const PUT = inngestServe.PUT;
```
</CodeGroup>

See the [SvelteKit example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-sveltekit) for more information.

### Framework: Tanstack Start 

Add the following to `./src/routes/api/inngest.ts`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts 
import { createServerFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

import { serve } from "inngest/edge";
import { inngest, functions } from "../../inngest";

const handler = serve({ client: inngest, functions });
    
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute('/api/inngest').methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => handler(request),
  POST: async ({ request }) => handler(request),
  PUT: async ({ request }) => handler(request)
})

```
</CodeGroup>

See the [Tanstack Start example](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/examples/framework-tanstack-start) for more information.

### Custom frameworks

If the framework that your application uses is not included in the above list of first-party supported frameworks, you can create a custom `serve` handler.

To create your own handler, check out the [example handler](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/blob/main/packages/inngest/src/test/functions/handler.ts) in our SDK's open source repository to understand how it works. Here's an example of a custom handler being created and used:

```ts
import { Inngest, InngestCommHandler, type ServeHandlerOptions } from "inngest";

const serve = (options: ServeHandlerOptions) => {
  const handler = new InngestCommHandler({
    frameworkName: "edge",
    fetch: fetch.bind(globalThis),
    ...options,
    handler: (req: Request) => {
      return {
        body: () => req.json(),
        headers: (key) => req.headers.get(key),
        method: () => req.method,
        url: () => new URL(req.url, `https://${req.headers.get("host") || ""}`),
        transformResponse: ({ body, status, headers }) => {
          return new Response(body, { status, headers });
        },
      };
    },
  });

  return handler.createHandler();
};

const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "example-edge-app" });

const fn = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "hello-world" },
  { event: "test/hello.world" },
  () => "Hello, World!"
);

export default serve({ client: inngest, functions: [fn] });
```

<GuideSection show="go">


Inngest enables you to create a HTTP handler for your functions. This handler will be used to serve your functions over HTTP (compatible with `net/http`).

```go {{ title: "Go (HTTP)" }}
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"github.com/inngest/inngestgo"
	"github.com/inngest/inngestgo/step"
)

func main() {
	client, err := inngestgo.NewClient(inngestgo.ClientOpts{
		AppID: "core",
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	_, err = inngestgo.CreateFunction(
		client,
		inngestgo.FunctionOpts{
			ID:   "account-created",
			Name: "Account creation flow",
		},
		// Run on every api/account.created event.
		inngestgo.EventTrigger("api/account.created", nil),
		AccountCreated,
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", client.Serve())
}
```

You expose your functions to Inngest through this HTTP endpoint.
Inngest provides integrations with Flask and FastAPI.

<CodeGroup>

import inngest.flask

logger = logging.getLogger(f"{app.logger.name}.inngest")

### Signing key

You'll need to assign your [signing key](/docs/platform/signing-keys) to an [`INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`](/docs/sdk/environment-variables#inngest-signing-key) environment variable in your hosting
provider or `.env` file locally, which lets the SDK securely communicate with Inngest. If you can't
provide this as a signing key, you can pass it in to `serve` when setting up your framework. [Read
the reference for more information](/docs/sdk/reference/serve#reference).

### Other configuration

When using `serve`, allow requests up to 4 MB in size. This is the maximum request size that Inngest will send to your app. Configurating maximum request size is framework-specific, so check the documentation for your framework for more information.

## Reference

For more information about the `serve` handler, read the [the reference guide](/docs/reference/serve), which includes:

* [`serve()` configuration options](/docs/reference/serve#serve-client-functions-options)
* [How the serve handler works](/docs/reference/serve#how-the-serve-api-handler-works)
